This measure includes all Medicare Part A and Part B payments made for services provided to a patient during an episode of care, which includes the 3 days prior to the hospital stay, the inpatient hospital stay, and the 30 days after discharge from the hospital.</p>                 <p>The MSPB measure score is a ratio calculated by dividing the amount Medicare spent per patient for an episode of care initiated at this hospital by the median (or middle) amount Medicare spent per episode of care nationally.
