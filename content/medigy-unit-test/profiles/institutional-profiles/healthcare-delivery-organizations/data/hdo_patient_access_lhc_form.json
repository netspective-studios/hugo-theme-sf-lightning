The HIPAA privacy rule states that healthcare organizations must grant patients access to their own medical records in a reasonable amount of time for a reasonable, labor-based fee. Interoperable EHRs and patient portals have streamlined this process, making patient data access almost entirely digital and opening up opportunities in the patient engagement space. About 90 percent of clinicians and hospitals offer patient portal access, and although subpar patient  adoption presents a challenge, industry leaders are eagerly working on what’s next for patient data access.",
