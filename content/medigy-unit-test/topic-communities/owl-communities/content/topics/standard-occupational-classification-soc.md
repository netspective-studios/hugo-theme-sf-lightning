Standard occupational classification (SOC) is a system that is used by federal statistical agencies for classifying workers & jobs into different occupational categories. This classification is mainly used to collect, calculate, analyze, or disseminate data. The SOC systems are employed for classifying all occupations which are payable or profitable. The jobs included in the SOC system are all jobs in the national economy, private, public, and military sectors.
