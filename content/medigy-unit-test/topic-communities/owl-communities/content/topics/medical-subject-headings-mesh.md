MeSH or Medical Subject Headings is a comprehensive, controlled & hierarchically-organized vocabulary produced by the NLM (National Library of Medicine). It serves as a thesaurus for indexing, cataloging, and searching for health and biomedical information. MeSH includes the subject headings in MEDLINE, PubMed, the NLM Catalog, and other NLM databases.
