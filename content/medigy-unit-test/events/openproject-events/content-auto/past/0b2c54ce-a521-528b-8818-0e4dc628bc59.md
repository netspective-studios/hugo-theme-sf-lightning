    Health is an important part of the GS1 reform process. Keep up to date with latest

    GS1 Recall Health is a standardised, industry-driven communication tool enabling
    healthcare organisations of any size, including manufacturers, suppliers, wholesalers,
    distributors, state health jurisdictions, hospitals and pharmacies to initiate,
    receive and share, real-time, product recall and non recall information in a secure
    and efficient manner. GS1 Recall Health has been developed in conjunction with
    major healthcare manufacturers, suppliers, distributors and the relevant federal
    and state health authorities and incorporates mandatory regulatory procedures
    in the initiation and communication of a product recall by the Therapeutic Goods
    Authority (TGA) - essential for the Australian healthcare sector.

     

    Existing subscribers to the GS1 Recall Health platform should attend the How to
    Use webinar. This event specifically discusses Therapeautic goods.'
