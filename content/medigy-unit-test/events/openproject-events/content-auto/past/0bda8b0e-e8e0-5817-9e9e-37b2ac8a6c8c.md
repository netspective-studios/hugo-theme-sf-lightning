The STS/ELSO ECMO Management Symposium is designed to provide an in-depth review of contemporary extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).As the number of patients requiring ECMO increases, so does the need for ongoing ECMO training for cardiothoracic surgeons and multidisciplinary intensive care teams.Symposium topics will include patient selection, initiation and separation of support, and patient and circuit management, as well as management of ECMO emergencies.Participants will experience several hours of high-fidelity simulation and extensive hands-on training.
