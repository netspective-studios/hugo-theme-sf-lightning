A biomarker is an indicator that can be accurately measured as a signal for normal biological function, pathogenic pathways, or drug response to therapeutic drug mediation. Biological markers are usually molecularly shaped. Biological markers occur in various bodily functions, including diagnosis and prognosis of the disease, prediction, and calculation of treatment response, and safety assessment. These biomarkers are developed and approved for use in drug development and support drug product's approval.

Biomarkers 2020 brings together experts from all aspects to meet and discuss the future of clinical research and the importance of biomarkers in todayâ€™s world to survive with better health. This conference discusses technological developments, new discoveries, and recent trends in biomarkers. There will be lectures, interactions, discussions, keynote addresses, poster presentations, etc. This conference gives you a chance to learn more about biomarkers.
