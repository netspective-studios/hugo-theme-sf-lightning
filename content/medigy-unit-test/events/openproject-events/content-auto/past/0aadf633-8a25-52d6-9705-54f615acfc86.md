The STS Coding Workshop is designed to provide cardiothoracic surgery coders, surgeons, and all billing professionals with the latest coding and reimbursement updates affecting surgical practices. Sessions will be presented using scenario-based questions, challenging coding examples, attendee interaction, and extensive Q&amp;A.

This 2-day, Friday-Saturday educational event will cover new and revised codes specific to cardiothoracic surgery, with concentrations in adult cardiac surgery, congenital heart surgery, general thoracic surgery, and vascular surgery. The program also will focus on reimbursement issues affecting the specialty as a whole. The Workshop will conclude with a special session on the physicianâ€™s role in documentation and reimbursement. Additionally, participants will have access to a series of supplemental online modules covering the global surgical period, modifiers, bundling, diagnosis, and coverage considerations to enhance their coding knowledge before and after the Workshop.
