We are delighted to invite you to the 17th World Congress of the EAPC in Helsinki, Finland, from 20-22 May 2021. 

All of us are experiencing growing demand, changing practice, and increasing challenges to the delivery of palliative care.  The 17th World Congress “Exploring New Dimensions” will give you the opportunity to be re-energised; to hear about exciting innovations and progress from within our palliative care community, as well as valuable contributions from the wider services and communities with whom we work. 

The EAPC Helsinki congress provides an excellent time and place to step back and reflect on progress we have made, and to consider the best ways forward. This is your chance to meet colleagues, and to be inspired and re-energised.

In September 2019, the United Nations High Level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage took place. In the subsequent political declaration, Heads and representatives of States and Governments declared a dedicated focus on universal health coverage, and strongly recommitted to achieve universal health coverage by 2030.  They recognised that universal health coverage means that all people and communities should be able to access and use the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services they need.  <br><br><a target="_blank" href=https://www.eapc-2021.org/general-information/words-of-welcome/>Read on eapc-2021.org</a>
