ESC Congress, beyond its commitment to excellence in science and education, is an opportunity to inspire. It is, first and foremost, a celebration of discovery unlike any other.

In this context, it is not surprising that so many healthcare professionals are drawn to this congress year after year: an event where they can interact and network with colleagues from more than 150 countries.
And through it all, there is one common, overriding goal: to expand the boundaries of cardiovascular medicine so that millions of more people can lead longer, healthier lives.

You can choose from a range of educational formats: Late-Breaking Science Sessions, Case-Based Sessions, Guidelines Presentations, and two rapidly growing favorites: How Should I Treat, and the Focus with the Experts Sessions.
