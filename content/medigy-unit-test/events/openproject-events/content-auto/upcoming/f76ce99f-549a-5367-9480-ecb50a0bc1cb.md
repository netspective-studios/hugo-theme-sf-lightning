Neuroscience or Neural Science involves the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. It is a place where psychology meets biology. Clinical Neuroscience is a branch of neuroscience focusing on the brain's diseases and disorders and central nervous system. Clinical neuroscience serves as a future of Psychiatry.  Neurolinguistics helps us to look at the similar constraints between the language and the brain. Neurorobotic models provide heuristics for developing and testing brain function theories in the context of phenotypic and environmental interactions. Also, neurorobotic models may provide a foundation for the development of more effective robots, based on an improved understanding of the biological basis of adaptive behavior.

Neurology manages the treatment and finds all classifications of conditions and illness, including the fringe and focal sensory system, including their covers, veins, and all effector tissue, such as muscle. Neurological Procedures could be defined with certain divisional tests like Lumbar puncture, Tensilon test.
