The 12th World Congress of the World Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (WSPID), taking place in Cancun, Mexico, on December 1-4, 2021.WSPID had its founding and first conference in Acapulco, Mexico in 1996 and we are delighted to return to Mexico after 25 years.The commitment and enthusiasm of our Mexican colleagues will ensure a memorable event.Cancun is a beautiful coastal city on the Yucatan peninsula with modern facilities and the remembrance of ancient civilizations.WSPID is the only global society that is devoted entirely to pediatric diseases in children.The conference takes place every alternate year in a locale accessible to colleagues from middle- and lower-income settings.Our Scientific Committee works hard to bring the best speakers and to address the most important issues in infectious diseases that affect children and their families.
