Image Repository is a vendor-neutral archive solution for imaging departments that need an easy way to archive and manage medical imaging data with a single view of imaging information across disparate healthcare enterprises.

* Reduce the number of individual systems that need maintenance and disaster recovery plans through centralized image data management.

* Provide a better way to archive, manage, and deliver your imaging data through a vendor-neutral image repository.

* Achieve economies of scale by investing in a single, larger storage platform for all medical image data. Youll find additional savings from never needing to migrate PACS data again.

* Enable image data sharing between disparate healthcare enterprises or systems, as legally permitted.

* Reduce the complexity of integrations and interfaces across the enterprise.
* Simplify enterprise-wide access to imaging information and facilitate enhanced clinical collaboration.
