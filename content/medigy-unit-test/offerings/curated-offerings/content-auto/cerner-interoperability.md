Data exchange impacts every aspect of health care today. Cerner Interoperability makes data flow freely using standards, network connections, and nationwide exchange to give clinicians access to relevant information regardless of source and support data sharing across the continuum. With a complete picture of the person, we empower clinicians to make better care decisions and plan appropriate care.

Cerner leads with standards, network connections, and nationwide exchange to make data sharing possible with any system regardless of EHR. We connect care organizations to relevant data from many different sources, including but not limited to:

* Other health venues
* Health information exchanges (HIE)
* CommonWell Health AllianceÂ® and Carequality
* State registries such as immunizations and prescription drug monitoring programs
* Provider and consumer health apps
