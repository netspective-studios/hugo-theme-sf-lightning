Our solutions are tailored to your financial experience, regardless of your balance, and without any negative consequences. With our patient portal, it is easy to manage your account. You can pay your bill manually or set up a monthly auto-draft. Regardless of credit history, all patients qualify for our program and have equal and fair payment terms. There are no negatives to using our payment plans. We never report to the credit bureau. We care about you and your finances, so we offer long term payment plans with 0% to low interest options. Consolidate your charges, along with bills from family members that received services from the same health system.
Our team will help you answer any questions you have and help you find the right payment plan. Many of our Patient Advocates are also AccessOne account holders and know the benefits of our program firsthand.
