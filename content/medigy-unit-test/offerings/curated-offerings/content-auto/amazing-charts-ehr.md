Amazing Charts was founded by a physician who understood the challenges independent physicians face daily. Because of this, our EHR is designed to enable clinicians to chart quickly and with the least number of clicks, while also keeping the cost affordable.

**Features and Benefits:**

**Charting**

Easy, one-click access to chart summaries, lab results, referral summaries, and past encounters summaries. No more re-documenting the same information.

**Templates:**

Amazing Charts templates are designed to work easily and minimize the risk that your notes all end up being essentially the same.

**e-Prescribing:**

Amazing Charts contains a robust and built-in e-Prescribing module. Powered by NewCrop, a SureScripts Certified Solution.

**Scheduling:**

Book, reschedule, and even document missed and no-show appointments. Set appointment types and duration and quickly rebook appointments.
