Collaborating for patient care requires constant connectivity and up-to-date information. Simplifying how you exchange that information with your payers is more important than ever. Availity makes it easy to work with payers, from the first check of a patients eligibility through the final resolution of your reimbursement.

Availity is the destination where providers connect with their payers to get the answers they need to focus on patient care. Availity solutions for providers include a free, online Provider Portal for real-time information exchange with many payers and a premium.

Our electronic data interchange (EDI) clearinghouse and API products allow providers to integrate HIPAA transactions and other features into their PMS, HIS, or EHR system or sophisticated custom applications. Built on a powerful, intelligent platform, we put data to work through business solutions that strengthen communications, improve financial performance, and simplify processes and systems.
