No need to call the front office to book appointments, patients in this digital age prefer to have their appointments scheduled online. Moreover, they can book them 24/7. Think about how much time your front office spends answering phone calls and managing queue to book appointments. With online appointment scheduling, your staff can get more time for other important work.

Doctors can manage their upcoming appointments through mobile apps and update their schedules. They can block the slots themselves, and the online calendars are automatically updated. SMS and Email Reminders are sent to patients when they book appointments and a day before the appointment, thereby reducing no-shows.

**Features:**

* Publish your doctor's calendar to your website.

* Enable Patients to book appointments online.

* Configure Provider Working Hours and Appointment Slots.

* Synchronize Appointments/Events with your Google Calendar.

* Secure and HIPAA Compliant.

* No Protected Health Information (PHI) is shared with Google.
