Our vision is to move specialty diagnostics and decision-making to the point of care for every patient exam. Our AI software empowers healthcare providers with new capabilities to acquire and interpret ultrasound exams. Our AI technology portfolio includes three capabilities drawn from the expertise of sonographers and doctors:

**Expert Guidance:**

Our groundbreaking Caption Guidance software uses AI to provide real-time guidance to enable healthcare providers, even those without prior ultrasound experience, to capture diagnostic-quality images to bring the benefits of ultrasound to more patients.

**Intelligent Interpretation**

Our interpretation software is trained on data from thousands of patients to provide an automated ejection fraction measurement that clinicians can use in their assessment.

**Automated Quality Assessment**

Our algorithms automatically select the best clips from a study and quantify their image quality, enabling improved image acquisition and interpretation confidence.
