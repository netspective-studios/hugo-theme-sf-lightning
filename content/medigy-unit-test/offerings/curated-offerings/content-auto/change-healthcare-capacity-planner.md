**Align Resources to Match Needs:**

* Accurately forecast patient demand with predictive analytics to optimize resources, drive better decision-making, and improve staff satisfaction. Increase your ability to respond to change.

* Leverage your data to improve operational and financial performance. Using your existing HIS, Capacity Planner creates a visual dashboard to show the impact of changes to your staffing, resources, or schedule.

* Focus on patient safety and improve care quality. By ensuring specialty demand is understood, Capacity Planner helps you mitigate clinical risk and match staff resources and beds to patient needs.

* Anticipate capacity blockages using modeling capabilities. Adjust your current processes to help minimize potential choking points.

* Improve productivity and maximize resources through precise staff allocation. Provide near-time access to information for educated decision making.

* Optimize patient flow from emergency to discharge. Use Capacity Planner to improve your average length of stay and discharge management.
