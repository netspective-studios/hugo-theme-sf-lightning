title: Sanofi turns to Google in search for better treatments
---

PARIS: French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi said Tuesday it is partnering with Google to use artificial intelligence and deep analytics tools to sift through its data to find better treatments.

The titan in online search "will apply technology and analytics on Sanofi's large real world database to better understand what treatments work for patients," the pharmaceutical firm said in a statement.

The use of Google's tools for deep analytics -- organising large amounts of data to make insights -- will help it better understand key diseases and patient outcomes to make further improvements.

Sanofi will also be moving some of its business applications to Google's cloud computing platform and use artificial intelligence to improve operations.

"Combining Sanofi's biologic innovations and scientific data with Google's industry-leading capabilities, from cloud computing to state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, we aspire to give people more control over their health and accelerate the discovery of new therapies," said Ameet Nathwani, who is Sanofi's chief digital officer in addition to being its chief medical officer and executive vice president.
