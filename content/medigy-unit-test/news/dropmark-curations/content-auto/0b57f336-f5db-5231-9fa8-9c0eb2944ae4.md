title: AMA raises questions about CDC's changes to COVID-19 testing guidance
---

The CDC this week issued controversial guidelines saying people without symptoms may not need to seek testing, even if they've been exposed to someone with the virus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week revised its official testing guidelines regarding asymptomatic people, triggering concerns from public health and industry groups.  

The new guidelines state that those without symptoms may not need a test, even if they have been in close contact with someone with a COVID-19 infection. The guidelines were similar for those in a high-transmission area who have attended a gathering of more than 10 people without widespread mask wearing or physical distancing.

"You do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one," reads the agency website.   

The American Medical Association and the Infectious Diseases Society of America were among groups who raised questions about the new guidelines, and noted that the novel coronavirus can be spread by those without symptoms.  

"Months into this pandemic, we know COVID-19 is spread by asymptomatic people," said AMA President Susan R. Bailey in a statement.
