title: Texas Health Resources improperly mails patients’ bills | Fort Worth Star
---

A major nonprofit healthcare system on Tuesday said that a billing error led to information about some of its patients across North Texas to be improperly mailed.

Texas Health Resources said information was “matched with and sent to the incorrect guarantor,” which is often a health insurance policy’s primary holder.

Texas Health spokesman Stephen O’Brien said late Tuesday that about 82,000 patients had been affected.

The information sent to errant recipients included patient names, account numbers, service dates, the names of treating physicians, names of health insurers, amounts owed and, in some cases, short service descriptions.
