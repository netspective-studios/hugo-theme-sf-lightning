title: How University of Rochester uses AI to reduce risk of failed follow-up

The University of Rochester Medical Center needed a better way to ensure that its many patients with incidental radiology findings received their recommended follow-up care in a timely manner.

THE PROBLEM

Failure to follow up happens for a number of reasons, including inconsistent communications during care transitions, not notifying patients of actionable test results, and inadequate systems for managing and tracking incidental findings.

“While a majority of incidental radiology findings are, thankfully, benign nodules, others turn out to be treatable forms of cancer,” said Dr. Ben Wandtke, medical staff president and chief of diagnostic imaging at UR Medicine Thompson Health and an associate professor in the department of imaging sciences at the University of Rochester Medical Center. 

“Unfortunately, due to gaps in communication, patients can fall through the cracks and not get into the proper cancer treatment right away," he said.

For example, the difference between a stage 1 cancer diagnosis and a stage 4 diagnosis can be a 50% or greater survival impact. Earlier diagnosis leads to improved patient care and better outcomes and can even result in a lower cost of care.
