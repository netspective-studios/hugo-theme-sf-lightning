title: House votes to lift ban on federal funding for unique patient identifier
---

Efforts to establish a unique patient identifier in U.S. healthcare—long advocated by many health IT leaders—moved a step closer to reality Wednesday when the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of lifting a ban on using federal funding to create patient identifiers.

The House voted 246 to 178 in favor of the Foster-Kelly amendment to H.R. 2740, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2020. 

The effort to overturn the 20-year-old ban now moves to the Senate.
