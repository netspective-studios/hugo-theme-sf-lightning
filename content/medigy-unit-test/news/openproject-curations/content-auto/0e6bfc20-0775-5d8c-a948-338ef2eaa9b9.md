A European consortium has been launched to accelerate the discovery and development of urgently needed medicines to treat SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Corona Accelerated R&D in Europe (CARE), is the largest undertaking of its kind dedicated to creating effective therapies with a positive safety profile and repurposing existing therapies for the pandemic.

It aims to boost R&D by bringing together the leading expertise and projects of 37 teams from academic, non-profit research institutions and pharmaceutical companies into a comprehensive drug discovery engine. It will integrate partners’ COVID-19 projects ongoing since February 2020.

The five-year project is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) and has received a grant of €77.7 million, funded by cash contributions from the European Union and contributions from 11 European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) companies and three IMI-associated partners.

Researchers will undertake drug repositioning; small-molecule drug discovery based on in silico screening and profiling of candidate compounds; and virus neutralising antibody discovery.

After testing in the laboratory, the project will advance the most promising drug candidates to clinical trials in humans.<br><br><a target="_blank" href=https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/europe/europe-s-largest-initiative-accelerate-therapy-development-covid-19-launched>Read on mobihealthnews.com</a>
