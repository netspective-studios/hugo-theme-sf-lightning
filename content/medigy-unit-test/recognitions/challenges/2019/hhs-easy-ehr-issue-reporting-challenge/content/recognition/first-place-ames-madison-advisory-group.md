James Madison Advisory Groupâ€™s unique solution for reporting possible safety events launches through a system tray icon or hotkey on any Windows 8 or higher installation. Use of the tray icon or hotkey keeps the user from exiting the EHR workflow, regardless of the EHR platform. The tool exports in the HHS Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Common Formats XML and PDF, captures screenshots, and simplifies the report delivery process. The winning submission is awarded $45,000.
