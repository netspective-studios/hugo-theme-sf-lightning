 As part of ongoing efforts to improve the safe use of health information technology (health IT) and electronic health records (EHRs), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced the winners of the Easy EHR Issue Reporting Challenge. Winners of this challenge created software tools that could help clinicians report EHR usability and safety issues faster, more efficiently, and in alignment with their regular clinical workflow. 

Many EHR users have indicated the need for more efficient and user-friendly mechanisms to facilitate reporting safety concerns quickly and easily, with little or no disruption to their clinical workflow.
