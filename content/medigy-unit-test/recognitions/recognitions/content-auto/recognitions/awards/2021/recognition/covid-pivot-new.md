This special award recognizes outstanding achievement by an organization that had to pivot their business, operations and/or marketing during the COVID-19 pandemic. To be considered for this award, the impact of the pivot should be any of the following: improved business, business continuation, better service to the community, or improved employee engagement. Examples: Shifting completely to telehealth appointments, focusing exclusively on a COVID software solution or device, moving to a digital-only marketing strategy. Separate awards for health IT companies, healthcare providers, and agencies.
