<h2>Chilmark Advisory Services Analytics Domain Monitor (January 2018)</h2>
<p>By Ken Kleinberg and Brian Edwards</p>
<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) gain traction in healthcare, marketing hype has increased. Healthcare organizations can vet and verify vendor claims against best practices by using operational definitions, gaining visibility into the model development environment, understanding the use of training data, and obtaining verified results from peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An increasing number of healthcare vendors use terms like AI and ML – hoping that the lack of clear definitions will let them hop on the bandwagon even though they might have only rudimentary use of these technologies.</li>
<li>Vendors with true AI/ML capabilities should be able to demonstrate value during model development and in execution.</li>
<li>An overview of Chilmark’s framework for evaluating vendors applying AI and ML, which can help organizations make investment decisions.</li>
</ul>
