            <p>The Biden administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/17/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-expand-and-improve-covid-19-testing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">today announced</a> a $1.6 billion investment to expand COVID-19 testing, increase manufacturing of testing supplies and spur virus genome sequencing.Â </p>

<p>The investment is described by the White House as a pilot program administered by the departments of Health and Human Services and Defense that will serve as a bridge until Congress delivers more funds through a relief bill. It includes:</p>

<ul><li>$650 million to expand testing in schools and underserved congregate settings, such as homeless shelters;</li>
	<li>$815 million to increase domestic manufacturing for testing-related supplies and raw materials, including filter pipette tips, nitrocellulose used in antigen point-of-care tests, and specific injected molded plastics needed to house testing reagents; and</li>
	<li>nearly $200 million for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-led efforts to identify, track and mitigate emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 through genome sequencing.</li>
</ul>
