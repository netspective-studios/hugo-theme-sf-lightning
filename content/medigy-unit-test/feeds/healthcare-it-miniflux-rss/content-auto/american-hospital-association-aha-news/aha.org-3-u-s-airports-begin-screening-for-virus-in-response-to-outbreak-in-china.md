            <p>In response to an outbreak in China caused by a new coronavirus, screenings to detect ill travelers going through San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles airports began today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0117-coronavirus-screening.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">announced</a>. Travelers on direct or connecting flights from Wuhan, China, will undergo entry screening for symptoms associated with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">2019-nCoV</a>. Among other measures, CDC deployed about 100 additional staff at CDC quarantine stations located at those airports to slow and reduce the spread of any disease into the U.S. Thailand and Japan each recently reported a case, but there are no known cases in the U.S. Based on current information, the risk from 2019-nCoV to the American public is currently deemed to be low, CDC said. For more information, see CDCâ€™s <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00426.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">updated guidance</a> for health care providers.</p>
