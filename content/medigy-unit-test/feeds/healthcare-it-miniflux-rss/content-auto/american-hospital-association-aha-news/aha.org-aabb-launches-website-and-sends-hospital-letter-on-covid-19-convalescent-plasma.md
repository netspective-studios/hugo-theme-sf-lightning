            <p>AABB <a href="http://www.aabb.org/press/Pages/pr200403.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">launched</a> a new website to inform the public, blood collectors and clinicians about COVID-19 convalescent plasma. The <a href="https://covidplasma.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">website</a> provides information to connect people who have recovered from COVID-19 to AABB-accredited blood centers so that they can potentially donate convalescent plasma to help improve the status of critically ill patients with COVID-19. AABB yesterday also sent a letter to its member hospitals encouraging them to collaborate with their blood supplier by identifying and referring individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 for donation of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. The Food and Drug Administration, which considers COVID-19 convalescent plasma an investigational treatment, recently announced <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemption-ide-process-cber/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">new guidelines</a> permitting its use for patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 infections. </p>
