title: Cisco Greece Drives Telehealth Through Donation
---

<p><strong>Cisco Greece has donated Cisco Webex DX80 collaboration endpoints to the University General Hospital of Thessaloniki AHEPA to provide telehealth services for patients in isolation.Â </strong></p>
<p>Helping our customers, partners, communities and people take advantage of technology in times of massive transformation is core to who we are at Cisco. During this challenging time, we are committed to supporting those in need.</p>
<p>For the Cisco Greece team, this commitment has been made through closely engaging with government agencies to support medical professionals and bringing telehealth capabilities to medical facilities and doctors at the University General Hospital of Thessaloniki AHEPA.</p>
<p>To enable direct and multi-party video communication between patients receiving treatment and their clinicians and families outside of isolation, Cisco Greece, along with our partners, made a generous donation of <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collaboration-endpoints/dx80/index.html?dtid=osscdc000283" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Cisco Webex DX80</a> collaboration endpoints to the University General Hospital of Thessaloniki AHEPA.</p>

<p>With the Cisco Webex DX80s, the treatment team can answer patient questions without being in the room and reduce visits by the hospital staff to the isolation wards. This means that the hospital can reduce the risk of physical contact between patients and clinicians, allow more frequent visits remotely, reduce consumption of personal protective equipment and save time by not having the care team dress in protective equipment, a process that can take up to 15 minutes per patient.</p>
<p>A huge thank you to the Cisco Greece team for their generous donation and for helping the University General Hospital of Thessaloniki AHEPA provide their patients with better care.</p>
