<p>Follow along with our new blog series <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/tag/healthcarenow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">#HealthcareNow</a> and <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/tag/publicsectornow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">#PublicSectorNow</a>, where we’ll address healthcare innovation around the world and how to maintain business continuity in today’s health climate.  </p>
<p>Now is the time for innovation and transformation in virtual health. During these unprecedented times of social distancing, stay at home orders and phased re-openings, one thing remains constant. Patients still need to receive quality care, and clinicians and care teams need a way to safely deliver that care. </p>
<p>This year the use of telehealth has increased exponentially. We’ve seen clinics, hospitals and healthcare organizations speed their telehealth deployment faster than previously possible, and patients, clinicians, care teams and administrative staff adopt this technology with speed and agility. </p>
<p>One <a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/feature-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=2064644" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Bay-area hospital saw a 2000% increase</a> in telehealth sessions in March.  </p>
<p>A Southeastern hospital system went from 0 to 5,000 telehealth visits in a three-week period in April.  </p>
<p><a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=2072576" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health</a> increased their virtual mental health visits by 750% between March and April.  </p>
<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/kPXSL6LjkNk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">University of Maryland Medical System</a> connected more than 28,000 employees across 13 hospitals and 5,000 homes in just 5 days.   </p>
<p>And these are just some of the incredible stories coming from our customers as they each evolve to address the challenges within today’s dynamic environment. </p>
<p>With telehealth more important than ever in today’s health climate, we were thrilled to be a sponsor of the <a href="https://www.americantelemed.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">American Telemedicine Association (ATA)’s</a> virtual conference in late June.  </p>
<p>The conference focused mainly on accelerating the adoption of telehealth and working to change the way the world thinks about healthcare. Throughout the week of engaging virtual sessions, Cisco gave two presentations around the current state of telehealth and the new normal in healthcare.   </p>
<p>Check out the sessions below and watch the on-demand recordings:  </p>
