<h2><em>What will the healthcare systems of tomorrow look like?</em></h2>



<p>This year, we’ve explored the <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/healthcare/the-future-of-healthcare" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">future of healthcare</a>. We’ve taken a look at the trends that are transforming the continuum of care across the globe. We watched as <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/healthcare/driving-the-future-of-healthcare-the-medibus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">the Medibus</a> drove innovation into remote German villages and seen how <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/healthcare/addressing-public-health-and-population-health-pain-points-with-mercy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Mercy</a> is personalizing patient experience and streamlining clinician experience. </p>



<p>One clear common denominator is that the future of care is about innovating to improve the patient experience. It emphasizes the outcome and finding better ways to expand the boundaries of what is possible in healthcare and for all of us. </p>



<h2><strong>Between healthcare now and healthcare new, there’s a bridge.</strong></h2>



<p>Healthcare now is changing. The people who touch healthcare – patients, family members, clinicians, administrators, and IT – expect more than ever before and need solutions that work for them.</p>



<p>Healthcare new is all about <strong><em>you</em></strong>. It’s healthcare everywhere. It’s on your terms. It’s where you want it. It’s when you need it. </p>

<p>Meet Ron.</p>

<p>Our interactive experience will take you through Ron’s journey and will showcase how technology expands the boundaries of what is possible in healthcare, and for Ron, like never before.</p>
