This is a use of the IHE published De-Identification Handbook against a use-case. The conclusion we came to is an important lesson, that sometimes the use-case needs can&#8217;t be met with de-identification to a a level of &#8216;public access&#8217;. &nbsp;That is that the &#8216;needs&#8217; of the &#8216;use-case&#8217; required so much data to be left in the resulting-dataset, that the resulting-dataset could not be considered publicly accessible. This conclusion was not much of a problem in this case as the resulting-dataset was not anticipated to be publicly accessible.
The de-identification recommended was still useful as it did reduce risk, just not fully. That is that the data was rather close to fully de-identified; just not quite. The reduced risk is still helpful.
Alternative use-case segmentation could have been done. That is we could have created two sets of use-cases, that each targeted different elements while also not enabling linking between the two resulting-datasets. However this was seen as too hard to manage, vs the additional risk reduction.
