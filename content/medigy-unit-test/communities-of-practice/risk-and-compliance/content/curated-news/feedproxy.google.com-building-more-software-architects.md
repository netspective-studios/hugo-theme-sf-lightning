In close to 30 years as a professional engineer, I find that some people are natural software architects, while others expert software engineers struggle with architecture. There seems to be a characteristic of those people that can take a step back and &#8216;architect&#8217;. &nbsp;Is this learned? I suspect anything can be learned. If so, what is the critical catalyst that triggers and feeds that learning?
I seem to run into people given the role of software architect, when they are more a subject-matter-expert on a specific project. &nbsp;On that project they are superior to all else, but they are not an architect. I seem to run into people who really want to become a software architect, but can&#8217;t seem to hack it.
I also see some excellent Architects get pulled into Management where they waste away. Or worse they end up Program Managers, simply because they are the only ones that know all the moving parts. I am not saying everyone should strive to be a software architect, or that it is the pinnacle.
I ask, because I think there are far too few true architects today. &nbsp;This more true as we enter the system-of-system-of-system world of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Being able to think short-term, long-term, horizontal-scale, depth-scale, modular, privacy, security, safety, reliability, continuous deployment, etc. All while being able to pivot when new information appears&#8230;
What are your top characteristics of a real software architect?How did they get that way?
