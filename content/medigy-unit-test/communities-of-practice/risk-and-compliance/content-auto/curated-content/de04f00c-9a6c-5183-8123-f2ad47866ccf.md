<p>GSA has rolled out a roadmap next year to accelerate the cloud vendor certification process under FedRAMP. Health systems and innovation ecosystem partners should consider FedRAMP Tailored and similar FedRAMP certifications as a pattern for how healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) should handle their security assessments.</p><p>GSA is working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a common machine-readable language — the <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/federal-cloud-report/2018/06/whats-next-for-fedramp-automation-new-authorizations-and-more-later-this-year/">Open Security Controls Assessment Language</a> (OSCAL) — to lay the foundation for future automation efforts. HDOs should be tracking OSCAL and begin to use it in their security assessments processes as soon as possible.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cloud-computing/2019/11/gsa-nist-look-at-automation-to-remove-fedramp-certification-hurdles/">Read on federalnewsnetwork.com</a></p>
