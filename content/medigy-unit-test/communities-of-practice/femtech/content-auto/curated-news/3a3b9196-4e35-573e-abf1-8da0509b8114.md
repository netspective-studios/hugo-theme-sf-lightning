In 2017, about 810 women around the world died every day from pregnancy-related causes. The United States' maternal mortality rate is an abysmal one, particularly for Black women and Native women – whose risk is three to four times higher than that of white women.

"I am so done with the numbers," said Fran Ayalasomayajula, head of the population health portfolio for worldwide healthcare, at HP. "I'm glad that now, after ten years, we have new data. Meanwhile, today somewhere 900 women are dying. Giving birth and dying. And we're still talking about the numbers. I am so done!"

Ayalasomayajula, a public health professional with a background in epidemiology, is the president and founder of Reach, whose mission is to improve health experiences for both patients and providers. 

In 2018, the Reach team selected maternal morbidity and mortality as a focus area. Now, in the final year of its three-year innovation life cycle, the team is moving to collaborate with stakeholders on developing demonstrations and solutions to address the maternal mortality pandemic.
