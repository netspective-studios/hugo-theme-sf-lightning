<p>Two scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry Wednesday for developing a way of editing genes likened to "molecular scissors" that offer the promise of one day curing inherited diseases.</p><p>Working on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Frenchwoman Emmanuelle Charpentier and American Jennifer A. Doudna came up with a method known as CRISPR-cas9 that can be used to change the DNA of animals, plants and microorganisms. It was the first time two women have won the chemistry Nobel togetherâ€”adding to the small number of female laureates in the sciences, where women have long received less recognition for their work than men.<br><br><a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-10-nobel-prize-chemistry-awarded-charpentier.html">Read on phys.org</a></p>
