<p>The femtech world is beginning to venture out of the boundaries of reproductive health and into other areas of women’s health, according to panelists at Bayer G4A summit yesterday.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the summer,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/femtech-market-has-unmet-segments-despite-industry-growth-report-says">Rock Health</a>&nbsp;report that about 65% of all femtech funding has gone into fertility, pregnancy or motherhood. Today innovators are looking beyond the reproductive umbrella, at how technology and research can be applied to the field of women’s health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a subset of the problem. As a woman certain reproductive medicine and reproductive health has been a part of my entire life, even into post menopause. However, there are a lot of other things about me that have nothing to do with that, that are part of my health journey,” Deborah Kilpatrick, co-CEO and executive chair of Evidation, said during the panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“So, I don’t think that it’s wrong, it’s just a small subset, a really important subset of women’s health, which is different than women’s health. We have to look at the health of women holistically, just like we look at the health of men holistically.”</p>
