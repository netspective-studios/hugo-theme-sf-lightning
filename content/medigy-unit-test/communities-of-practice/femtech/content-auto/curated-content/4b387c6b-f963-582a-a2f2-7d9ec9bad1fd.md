Balancing the demands of motherhood has never been easy. And, with Covid-19 forcing many women to be an employee, parent and teacher all at once, many working moms are having a hard time keeping it all together.

In fact, 74% of U.S. mothers say they feel mentally worse since the pandemic began, according to a survey by motherhood lifestyle brand [Motherly](https://www.mother.ly/news/state-of-motherhood-survey/burnout-is-real). The report, which gathered responses from more than 3,000 millennial moms between March 9 and April 23, found that 97% of moms between the ages of 24 and 39 say they feel burned out at least some of the time, with the pandemic only making things worse.
