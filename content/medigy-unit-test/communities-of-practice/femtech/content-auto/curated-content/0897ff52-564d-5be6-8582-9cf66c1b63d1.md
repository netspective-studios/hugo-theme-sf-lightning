Neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) deliver services and treatment to millions of women in the United States each year. [1] Unfortunately, many expectant mothers miss out on the vital services provided by NNPs. To mitigate potentially harmful complications, neonatal nurse practitioners conduct treatment and interventions that aim to bring services to expectant mothers in their communities.

Births that occur before the appropriate gestation period typically result in newborns with low birth weights and other health complications. [2] While not all premature births result in complications, this event can cause short- and long-term health problems. Conditions may present at birth or later in the child’s lifespan and may include some of the following ailments. Breathing complications may arise due to underdeveloped respiratory organs. Heart problems are another common condition that presents among premature children. Early births can also lead to interventricular hemorrhaging, which is bleeding in the tissue of the brain. Finally, premature births might result in a condition where newborns’ bodies cannot compensate for normal heat loss.

The following five innovations aid neonatal nurse practitioners in diagnosing and treating conditions that commonly present among premature children.
