With today’s fast-paced life come the problems of infertility and the need for better family planning. Therefore, the need to extend a woman’s childbearing window has become a requirement. We all know that nature doesn’t work that way, however with medical advances, doctors have been able to provide women with the boon of becoming mothers when they are ready.

The elective process of egg freezing is slowly becoming mainstream. From a medical standpoint, it is no longer considered experimental. Companies are starting to add it as a part of the employee insurance, and cryopreservation banks provide the woman with a safe environment for fertility preservation.

Egg freezing is the process of removing young, healthy eggs from the ovaries and freezing them in a lab. Medically, this process is referred to as oocyte cryopreservation.
