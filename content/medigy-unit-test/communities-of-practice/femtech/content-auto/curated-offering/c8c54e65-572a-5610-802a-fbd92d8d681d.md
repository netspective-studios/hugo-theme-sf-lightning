The GDm-Health app is part of a system that helps clinicians manage diabetes in pregnancy.

The system comprises a patient app that can receive readings wirelessly from a blood glucose monitor, and a web-app dashboard for use by medical professionals.

Using the web-app dashboard, clinicians can view your blood glucose readings in real-time and proactively manage your condition.Â
