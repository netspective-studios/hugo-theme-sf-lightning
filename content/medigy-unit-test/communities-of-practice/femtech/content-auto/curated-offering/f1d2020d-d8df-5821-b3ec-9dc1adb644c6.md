<p>Lully is a device that prevents night terrors in young children, helping better the quality of their sleep as well as that of their family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Lully consists of a vibrating pod and a smartphone app. The pod is placed under the child's mattress and communicates with a smartphone via Bluetooth. It vibrates for a period of three minutes just as the child enters the phase of deep sleep during which night terrors occur. The app tracks children's sleeping patterns so parents know when to turn the Lilly on.<br><br><a href="https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/lully">Read on trendhunter.com</a></p>
