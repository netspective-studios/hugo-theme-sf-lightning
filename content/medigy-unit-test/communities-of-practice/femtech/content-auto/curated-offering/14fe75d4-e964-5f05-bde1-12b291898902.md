    information to guide acute neonatal intensive care.


    ** Winner NHS Innovation Challenge Acorn Prize 2015 **


    NeoMate is based upon established guidelines used by the London Neonatal Transfer
    Service (NTS), an organisation that transfers unwell babies between neonatal units
    in London and the South East of England. By standardising the care given to babies,
    it is hoped that the app will improve safety by reducing variability of prescribing
    practices and local guidelines between different units.'
