This morning Apple became the next tech giant to jump into the coronavirus resource space, with the launch of its COVID-19 website and corresponding app.

The new site, which serves as both a screening tool and information platform, was born out of a collaboration with Apple, the CDC, the White House Coronavirus Task Force and FEMA.

Users are able to go onto the site and answer a list of questions including symptoms, risk factors and exposure. At the end of the survey users are given a directive about possible next steps. For example, "self-isolate" or "contact your work's occupational health provider."

Folks are also able to tap into resources about how to socially isolate, when to get a test, and how to monitor symptoms.

Users are also able to ask Siri about coronavirus symptoms and get a guidance resources from the CDC and directions to telehealth apps.
