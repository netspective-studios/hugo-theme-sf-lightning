As of 8 April, Italy was the most COVID-19-affected country in Europe. Of 135 000 confirmed cases over 6,000 were health care professionals, and 94 of those have died, the authors of the study (Fiorino et al. 2020) note. In the region of Lombardy hospital overcrowding has been the most severe in the country, and GPs there are frequently exposed to the virus, which has already led to 20 deaths.
