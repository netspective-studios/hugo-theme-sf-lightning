President Donald Trump outlined new guidelines for Americans to follow for 15 days in order to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak, according to his remarks at Monday’s White House Coronavirus Task Force press briefing.

The White House is now recommending that people stay home when possible, including young and healthy people. Schooling and working from home are among the recommendations. Groups of 10 or more should be avoided as should discretionary travel and eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts, he said.

Toward the end of the briefing, Anthony Fauci, MD, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health, added that in “small print” on the guidelines, “In states with evidence of community transmission, bars, restaurants, food courts, gyms, and other indoor and outdoor venues where groups of people congregate, should be closed.”

Trump clarified that so far that is a recommendation, but not an order.

“It’s important for the young and healthy people to understand that while they may experience milder symptoms, they can easily spread this virus, and they will spread it indeed, putting countless others in harm’s way,” Trump said. “We especially worry about our senior citizens.”

The coronavirus outbreak will slow, Trump added, “with several weeks of focused action.”

Coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx, MD, also appealed to millennials, reminding them that even gatherings in the home should be limited to less than 10 people.

“We really want people to be separated at this time, to be able to address this virus comprehensively that we cannot see, for which we don’t have a vaccine or a therapeutic,” Birx said. “The only thing we have right now is the amazing ingenuity and compassion of the American people.”
