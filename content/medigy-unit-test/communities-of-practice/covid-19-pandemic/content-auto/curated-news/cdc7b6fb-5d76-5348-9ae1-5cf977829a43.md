  description: Telemedicine and technology are crucial ways to deliver care and keep
    our health care workers, patients and vulnerable populations safe, especially
    amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This discussion is designed to share best practices
    and the latest policy and payment updates to support physicians and practices
    in expediting the implementation of telemedicine. This conversation should also
    outline the ways in which technology and telemedicine can strengthen physician/patient
    relationships, even in trying times like those of the current COVID-19 pandemic,
    so care can continue to be provided to those who need it most.
