Looks like HHS has <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/04/10/hhs-to-begin-immediate-delivery-of-initial-30-billion-of-cares-act-provider-relief-funding.html">partnered with UnitedHealth Group</a> to deliver the initial $30 billion. Providers will be paid via Automated Clearing House account information on file with UHG, UnitedHealthcare, or Optum Bank, or used for reimbursements from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). If you normally receive a paper check for reimbursement for CMS, a paper check will be sent in the next few weeks.<br><br><a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/2020/04/10/the-latest-hhs-cms-and-ocr-funding-and-regulatory-changes-in-response-to-covid-19/">Read on healthcareittoday.com</a><br>&nbsp;</p>
