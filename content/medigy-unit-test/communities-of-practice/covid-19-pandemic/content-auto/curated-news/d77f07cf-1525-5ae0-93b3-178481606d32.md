The United Health Foundation has pledged $5 million to support three organizations that help the homeless and those who are food insecure during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Of the $5 million, $2.5 million will go to the National Health Care for the Homeless Council to support both the immediate need for homeless programs as well as longer-term expanded housing capacity.

Another $1.5 million is going to the Feeding America network of member food banks for COVID-19 response needs, such as purchasing additional food to meet sudden increases in demand, supporting new distribution approaches and responding to a sudden decline in volunteers.

And $1 million will go to Meals on Wheels America to support local programs serving vulnerable seniors.
