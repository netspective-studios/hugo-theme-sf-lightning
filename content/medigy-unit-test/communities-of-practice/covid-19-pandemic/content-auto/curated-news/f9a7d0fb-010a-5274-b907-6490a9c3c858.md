    are warned that the document has not been peer-reviewed by expert/patient reviewers
    or an academic editor, may contain misleading claims, and is likely to undergo
    changes before final publication, if accepted, or may have been rejected/withdrawn.
    Readers with interest and expertise are encouraged to sign up as peer-reviewer,
    if the paper is within an open peer-review period. Please cite this preprint only

    <strong>Background:</strong> The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP)
    Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) have successfully
    worked together on the surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases
    for over 50 years, including three previous pandemics. With the emergence of the
    international outbreak of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19), a UK national
    approach to containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure
    to COVID-19. At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC’s surveillance has
    been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19
    infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment
    strategy.\n<strong>Objective:</strong> The aim of this study is the surveillance
    of COVID-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory
    infections to ascertain both the rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread and to assess
    the effectiveness of the containment policy.\n<strong>Methods:</strong> The RCGP
    RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, extract pseudonymized
    data weekly. This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording
    in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19.
    Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new
    codes to support this. (2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing
    people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)—with
    the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19
    should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary
    care. (3) Serology sample collection across all age groups. This will be an extra
    blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a
    scheduled blood test. The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza
    virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological
    surveillance. (4) Collecting convalescent serum samples. (5) Data curation. We
    have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed.
    Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories.\n<strong>Results:</strong>
    General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set
    of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance. Additionally, practices participating
    in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance
    from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs. Within the first 2 weeks of setup
    of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system,
    the other 2 through the extended virology sampling.\n<strong>Conclusions:</strong>
    We have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance
    system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy.
    The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported.
    Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.\n "
