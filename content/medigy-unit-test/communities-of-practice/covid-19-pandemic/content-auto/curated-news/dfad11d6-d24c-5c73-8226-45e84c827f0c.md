With growing concern of shortages for personal protective equipment and other supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic, Premier has teamed up with supply chain mapping and disruption monitoring services specialist Resilinc to launch an exchange to locate and trade critical supplies.

The cloud-based platform, developed in collaboration with Stanford Medicine and called The Exchange, allows hospitals and frontline healthcare providers to submit requests for specific items and be matched with peer organizations who can provide the needed supplies.

The tool can expedite communications between thousands of networked hospitals and help place critical medical supplies where they are needed most.

"Many hospitals searching for items that are on allocation by suppliers must manually locate other hospitals who have inventory," Bindiya Vakil, CEO and founder of Resilinc, said in a statement. "This can be time consuming, less successful and has a narrow geographic reach."
