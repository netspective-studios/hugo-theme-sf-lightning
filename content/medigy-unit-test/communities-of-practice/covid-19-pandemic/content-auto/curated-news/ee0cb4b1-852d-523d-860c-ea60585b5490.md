<p>Yesterday, CMS <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/trump-administration-makes-sweeping-regulatory-changes-help-us-healthcare-system-address-covid-19">announced</a> an unprecedented level of <a href="https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/emergency-preparedness-response-operations/current-emergencies/coronavirus-waivers">Blanket Waivers</a> and <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/additional-backgroundsweeping-regulatory-changes-help-us-healthcare-system-address-covid-19-patient">Regulatory changes</a> to allow healthcare organizations to better deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; Many states had requested these waivers and been granted them, but now it applies to any state.&nbsp; AHIP has said that payers will follow suit in overwhelmed areas.&nbsp; AHIP has collated many of the <a href="https://www.ahip.org/health-insurance-providers-respond-to-coronavirus-covid-19/">payer’s response to COVID-19</a>.</p><p>The biggest news amidst all the changes is true payment parity for teleahealth (see <a href="https://t.co/f8xDB5DvvA?amp=1">page 15 of the IFC</a> for the specific details – Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/Travis_Broome/status/1245026348172808194">Travis Broome</a>).&nbsp; If the telehealth visit is replacing an in-person visit, then CMS will pay the same as they would for an in-person visit.&nbsp; This is going to have the biggest impact on revenue for healthcare organizations and is a good change that I hope will last far past COVID-19.&nbsp; Not to mention we need commercial payors to adopt it as well.<br><br><a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/2020/03/31/major-cms-waivers-and-regulatory-changes-during-covid-19-pandemic/">Read on healthcareittoday.com</a></p>
