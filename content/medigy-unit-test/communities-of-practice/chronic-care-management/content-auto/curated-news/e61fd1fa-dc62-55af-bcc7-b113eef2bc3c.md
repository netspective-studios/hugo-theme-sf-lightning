The proposed changes, would allow Medicare providers to conduct evaluation and management (E/M) home visits for established patients virtually, allow an emergency room E/M virtual visit for minor to moderately severe health issues and expand some telehealth services similar to telehealth services already covered by Medicare, like for group psychotherapy or care for patients with cognitive impairment. Nine new telehealth codes will be permanent, and 13 will be covered through the calendar year in which the public health emergency ends, to give physicians a chance to deliver services virtually before CMS decides whether or not to permanently allow them.
