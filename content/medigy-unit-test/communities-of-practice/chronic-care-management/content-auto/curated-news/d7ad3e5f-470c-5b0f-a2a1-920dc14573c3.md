<p>A recent study published in the&nbsp;<i>American Journal of Managed Care</i>&nbsp;found that provider use of a shared inpatient-outpatient electronic health record was associated with a shift toward follow-up delivered through a combination of telemedicine and outpatient laboratory tests, with no differences in 30-day emergency department visits.</p><p>"Timely availability of clinical information during health care transitions, in a setting with robust telemedicine access, can shift the method of care delivery without adversely affecting patient health outcomes," wrote the researchers.&nbsp;The integrated EHR automatically includes patient history and clinical information with the outpatient EHR used by primary care providers and specialists, including order-entry capability for follow-up, medication reconciliation, secure messaging and notifications to outpatient providers that patients had been hospitalized. &nbsp;</p>
