<p>Better performing medical practices spend almost 9% more on their operations than their peers according to a&nbsp;new report&nbsp;released by the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA). These same practices enjoyed higher revenues and physician compensation compared to the average.</p><p>According to the report, better performing practices spent, on average, $884,979 per full-time-equivalent (FTE) physician while their peers only spent $814,342. Yet despite having higher operational costs, these same practices generated almost 18% more revenue and had physician compensation that was 19% more than the average. These findings demonstrate that investing smartly in people, technology, and improved processes pay off (literally!).</p>
