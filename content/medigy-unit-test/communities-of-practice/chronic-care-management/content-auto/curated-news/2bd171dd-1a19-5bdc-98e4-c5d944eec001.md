Raleigh-based WakeMed Health & Hospitals will be using the mHealth platform, a partnership between UPS and California-based drone company Matternet, to ferry supplies from external sites to the health systemâ€™s main campus.

The program, which will be overseen by the Federal Aviation Authority and North Carolina Department of Transportation, is the latest effort to develop a telehealth platform for autonomous drones. UPS first tested the delivery method in 2016, ferrying blood products to remote parts of Rwanda, and Matternet has been using drones to connected healthcare providers in Switzerland since 2015.

The connected care service could also speed up diagnoses and treatment times for patients and providers living in remote regions and facilitate the delivery of clinical supplies such as medications, vaccines, and hard-to-find equipment.
