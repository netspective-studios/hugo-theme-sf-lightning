<p>The&nbsp;emergence of Blockchain technology&nbsp;is set to play an ever-increasing role within healthcare settings within the next two years, according to industry experts. One organisation focusing on its potential is global consultancy and software development company DataArt, which sees more healthcare organisations embracing its applications in the not too distant future.</p><p>Blockchain is a&nbsp;continuously growing list of records&nbsp;- called blocks - which are linked and secured using cryptography. It has security elements which mean it is difficult to make unauthorised modifications to the data which is exchanged in a system that is an open distribution ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.</p>
