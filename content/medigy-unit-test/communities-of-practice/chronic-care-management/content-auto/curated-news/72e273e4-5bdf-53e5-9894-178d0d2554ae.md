title: COVID-19 has Accelerated Adoption of Non-Contact Patient Monitoring Technology,
  Says Frost & Sullivan Analysis

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an opportunity for non-contact patient monitoring technologies, which can facilitate the early detection of respiratory complications in suspected patients while reducing the chances of infection among physicians and healthcare workers.

“These technologies can also be leveraged by pharmaceutical companies to monitor the results of the drugs developed by them," said Ashish Kaul, technical insights senior research analyst at Frost & Sullivan.

According to the analysis by Frost & Sullivan, non-contact patient monitoring technologies gravitate toward the use of video, sound analysis, and mobile-based platforms incorporating advanced technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.

Kaul said: "The healthcare industry is shifting its focus to value-based, patient-centric remote monitoring solutions, providing a fillip to the research of non-contact monitoring technologies. Non-contact technologies are unobtrusive, cost-effective, and can be used to monitor multiple users, making them an effective solution for monitoring patients en masse.”
