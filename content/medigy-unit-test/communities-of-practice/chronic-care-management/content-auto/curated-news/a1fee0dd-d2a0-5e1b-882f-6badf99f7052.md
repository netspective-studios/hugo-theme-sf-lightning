<p>Like so many other health systems, the Mayo Clinic ramped up its telehealth platform to address the coronavirus pandemic, adopting digital health tools and processes that normally would have taken a decade to put in place.</p><p>Now, the Minnesota-based health system is dealing with the challenges associated with sudden growth and looking to create a connected health network that can seamlessly accommodate both in-person and virtual care. And that means making sure the consumer-friendly front door meshes with the clinician-friendly back end.</p><p>It’s not easy adapting to an EHR – many health systems still haven’t done it, much to the chagrin of either the health system or the EHR vendor. But many have, and in doing so, they’ve automated what Ross calls “everything that doctors need to get their work done.”</p>
