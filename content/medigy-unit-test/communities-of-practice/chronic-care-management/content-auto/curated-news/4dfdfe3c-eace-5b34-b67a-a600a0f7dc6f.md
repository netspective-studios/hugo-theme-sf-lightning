 In its first decade, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) introduced and honed models to support value-based care, exploring multiple avenues for lowering costs and refining risk adjustment strategies.

“2020 marked the tenth anniversary of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), and it proved to be a very important year both for the Innovation Center and the broader value-based care movement,” reflected Brad Smith, CMS deputy administration and director of CMMI.

The former model emphasized care coordination and value-based care. The second model targeted better processes, health outcomes, and healthcare spending for dual eligibles specifically. The third model, CHART, reinforced rural healthcare by providing funds and flexibilities for strategies such as transformative care delivery reform.

In addition to introducing new models, CMMI also exercised and improved upon previously established models.
