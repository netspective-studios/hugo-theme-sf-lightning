When the coronavirus hit, front-line hospitals saw their telehealth services surge. Some providers struggled to keep up with the demand, either by not having enough doctors trained in telehealth to handle the increased caseload or relying on a telehealth vendor that didn’t have the available resources to keep the online platform running smoothly. 

Some of the bigger vendors, having weathered the storm, will stake their ground, while smaller companies will either drop out or focus on specific pain points, specialties, or services, like eConsults. On the flip side, providers large and small may rethink their telehealth strategy, choosing to put their resources into their service lines rather than a hosted platform.
