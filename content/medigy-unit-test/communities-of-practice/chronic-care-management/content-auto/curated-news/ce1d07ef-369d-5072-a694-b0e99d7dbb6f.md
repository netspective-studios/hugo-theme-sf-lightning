<p>A well-designed SMART (Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies) on FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) EHR application that focuses on chronic disease management proved effective for addressing clinician burden,&nbsp;according&nbsp;to a study published in the&nbsp;Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association&nbsp;(JAMIA).</p><p>Specifically, the FHIR-based technology increased the number of tasks a provider could do while decreasing the number of keystrokes necessary to do those tasks.</p><p>EHR users commonly face EHR usability and display issues. Currently, most EHRs display separate screens for separate sections of care in the EHR. Therefore, clinicians must create a separate order entry module to develop clinical plans and place orders, while using a second workflow for preventative care.</p>
