<p>As COVID-19 cases rise in Virginia during the holiday season, Gov. Ralph Northam has announced a $10 million investment of the state’s CARES Act funding will go toward a new statewide technology platform to connect government agencies, health care providers, and residents.</p><p>The e-referral system, called United Virginia, will integrate existing electronic medical record systems used by hospitals and medical care facilities. The platform is intended to make it easier for health care providers to refer patients to social service organizations that provide food, housing, transportation, and employment services.</p><p>The Cares Act funding will support the initial startup and implementation costs of the statewide network, Northam’s office said.</p>
