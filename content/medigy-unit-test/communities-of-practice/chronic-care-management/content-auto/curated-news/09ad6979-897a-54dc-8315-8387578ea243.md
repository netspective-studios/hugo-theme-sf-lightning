The CDC says six in 10 Americans suffer from a chronic illness -- and four in 10 have two or more. Yet AAFP data indicate that fewer than half of family physicians provide chronic care management services to Medicare patients. 

One reason: Medicare&#39;s CCM benefit, introduced in 2015, remains limited by CMS cost-sharing rules that impose administrative burdens on physicians while increasing both toll and confusion for beneficiaries. 

The Academy has long pressed CMS and lawmakers to remove such co-insurance requirements for Medicare&#39;s CCM service codes. Now, a bill being considered in the House might finally do just that.
