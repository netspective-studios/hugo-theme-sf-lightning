<p>A hallmark of the COVID-19 story, so far, is adaptability. This applies to what we're doing at home and at work, which, for many of us, <i>is</i> <i>at home</i>. Hospitals have adapted well to the pandemic. They have redesigned patient care while relentlessly communicating those efforts to staff, communities, regulators and elected officials.</p><p>While nurses and doctors rightfully are hailed as heroes, hospital administrators were decisive, fast-acting, and nimble. In response to the pandemic, many rapidly expanded telemedicine capabilities created virtual hospitals, deployed testing in underserved communities, and became advisors to lawmakers and business owners about safely reopening the economy.</p><p>Their expanded roles and far-ranging actions have created extraordinary, new demands on hospital communication functions. Hospital CCOs and their teams are keeping employees informed and aligned, coordinating communication with public health agencies and elected officials, and reassuring the public <i>we’ve got this</i>–that hospital systems can provide high-quality, safe treatment for COVID-19 patients and others seeking care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
