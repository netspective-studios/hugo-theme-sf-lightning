<p>Value-based care payment models that focused on a global budget were home runs in a recent Trump administration review, but bundled payment results were more mixed.</p><p>Brad Smith, the head of the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) that oversees value-based care payment models, gave during the National Association of Accountable Care Organizations' fall conference Tuesday&nbsp;details of the agency’s review of the performance of every model.</p><p>Some of the winners were ones that had a “clear thesis” about quality and cost improvements, Smith said.He pointed to Maryland’s Total Cost of Care model as an example. The model sets a per capita limit on Medicare costs in the state.</p>
