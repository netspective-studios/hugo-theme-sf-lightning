According to the proposed 2021 Physician Fee Schedule, CMS is planning to keep nine codes added during the COVID-19 crisis and add 13 new codes. But 74 codes are slated to end when the public health emergency is over.

The 13 new codes proposed for inclusion in the Physician Fee Schedule are grouped in a new category, Category 3 (the Category 1 codes are slated to remain in place, and the Category 2 codes are scheduled for elimination). According to Lacktman and Goodman, these codes will remain in place through the end of 2021, and they represent an effort by CMS to gradually expand telehealth coverage as it looks for evidence to support them.
