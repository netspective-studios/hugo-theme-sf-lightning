Higher Star Ratings not only demonstrate care quality current and potential members; they mean additional financial incentives from CMS in the form of bonus payments and rebates for superior quality and member/beneficiary service.
A  study shows that increasing a planâ€™s Star rating from 3 to 4 can result in an 8% to 12% increase in enrollment. With that bump in enrollment, an MA plan could bring in millions of dollars in revenue in the form of bonuses and rebates.
Improving Star Ratings can be challenging, especially because many of the metrics that comprise the ratings are contingent on patient behavior, which can be difficult for plans to influence. Despite these complexities, healthcare organizations that administer MA plans can now directly address patient behavioral change by partnering with their providers to implement mobile-enabled remote patient monitoring (mRPM).
