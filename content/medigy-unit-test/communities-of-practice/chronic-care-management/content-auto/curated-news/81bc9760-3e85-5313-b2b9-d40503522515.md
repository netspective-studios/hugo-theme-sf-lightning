<p>In the final rule, to qualify for reimbursement under CPT codes 99457 and 99458, CMS mandated at least 20 minutes of interactive communication time between provider and patient over a calendar month, but that interactive communication couldn’t be part of the 20 minutes of RPM care. The agency has now clarified that “interactive communication” can include both in-person and connected health channels.</p><p>Both the Alliance for Connected Care – which drew attention to this week’s corrections – and the healthcare team at Foley &amp; Lardner criticized the initial guidelines when they were released in a preliminary draft last August.</p><p>In addition, CMS added more context to a requirement that bases RPM reimbursement on a minimum of 16 days of data collected over a 30-day period and said RPM services associated with CPOT codes 99453 and 99454 could be billed once per provider per patient per 30-day period.</p>
