New research suggests that mHealth is changing the way physicians treat patients with chronic conditions.

Telehealth and telemedicine advocates say a digital therapeutic platform for chronic care – ranging from asthma to cardiac care to diabetes – can help providers improve care management and coordination by giving them a better idea of medication management and adherence. This not only improves the care plan and clinical outcomes but also helps patients with self-management.

When treating patients living with asthma, for example, a physician who relies on a patient’s memory of inhaler use won’t get an accurate care management profile, affecting how that doctor maps out a care plan. A physician who combines patient perceptions with data from a mHealth sensor that measures inhaler use will have a much better idea of how that patient is doing.
