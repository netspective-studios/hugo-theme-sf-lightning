Humana is partnering with Philips on a remote patient monitoring program that will equip selected Medicare Advantage members living with CHF with a telemedicine kit to improve care management at home.

Payers are starting to take a serious look at remote patient monitoring programs to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs for members with complex medical concerns.

Humana – long an advocate for telehealth and mHealth interventions – announced a partnership with Philips to launch what it calls a “remote member monitoring” pilot for select Medicare Advantage members with severe congestive heart failure.

“Our goal is to continue to find ways to help our Medicare Advantage members stay longer and safer in their homes,” Susan Diamond, president of Humana’s Home Business segment, said in a press release.
