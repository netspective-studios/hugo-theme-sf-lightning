The wearable technology market is quickly evolving into a major tech segment thanks to a growing consumer market driven by the sales of smartwatches. A major segment of the wearable technology market is wearable medical tech, which is mostly focused on monitoring medical data and aiding diagnostics. Traditionally, patient monitoring devices are used in hospitals to monitor a patient's vital signs. Nowadays, with the advancements in wireless technology, these devices can be used to remotely monitor a patient's various physiological parameters. Today, during a severe viral pandemic, remote monitoring medical devices have become a crucial component of healthcare. In fact, earlier in March, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed certain FDA-cleared non-invasive, vital sign-measuring devices to expand their use so that health care providers can use them to monitor patients remotely.
