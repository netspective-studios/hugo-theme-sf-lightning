Texas lawmakers are moving toward passage of a bill that would expand Medicaid coverage for telehealth and telemedicine and mandate payment parity.

The bill directs the State Health and Human Services Commission to ensure that Medicaid providers can’t deny coverage for connected care because it isn’t offered in person. It also directs Medicaid managed care organizations to reimburse providers at the same rate as in-person services and prevents MCOs from limiting the provider’s choice of telemedicine platform.

SB 670 “would reduce health care costs and improve access to care for all Texans, especially those in rural areas. By removing unnecessary and burdensome regulations in Medicaid limiting the provision of telemedicine and telehealth services,” a House Research Organization report says in summarizing testimony from the bill’s supporters.
