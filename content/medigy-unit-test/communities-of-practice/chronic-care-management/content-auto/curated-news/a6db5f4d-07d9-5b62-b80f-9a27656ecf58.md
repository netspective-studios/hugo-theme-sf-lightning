<p>There are several factors driving collaboration across the healthcare ecosystem. Consumer demand, the shift to value-based care, and the regulatory push for transparency are fueling the need for seamless integration and data sharing only achieved with cloud-based interoperability.&nbsp;</p><p>COVID-19 further underscores the importance of a centralized approach, which can more quickly arm the medical community with real-time information to help them fight the pandemic in addition to driving efficiencies and reducing costs in accessing, providing, and paying for healthcare. Physicians are increasingly adopting cloud-based interoperability, creating a more connected system that can streamline the healthcare process, which delivers better clinical and financial outcomes and ultimately improves the healthcare experience for all.</p>
