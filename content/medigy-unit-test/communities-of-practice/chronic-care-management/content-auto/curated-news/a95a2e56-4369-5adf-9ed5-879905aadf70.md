For years, CMS balked at reimbursing physicians for remote patient monitoring (RPM) and other types of non-face-to-face care, but it seems those days are over. During the past two years, the agency has built on its existing coverage of chronic care management-related RPM services by adding new codes for RPM reimbursement. Physicians who haven’t yet taken advantage of these new reimbursement codes because of concerns about staffing or implementation may want to consider leveraging mobile-enabled remote patient monitoring (mRPM). This technology is much more efficient and cost-effective than past approaches such as telephonic RPM. Easy to implement, it can provide nearly immediate clinical and financial value for large group practices or solo practices with minimal clinical support staff. <br><br><a target="_blank" href=https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/whats-new-remote-patient-monitoring>Read on medicaleconomics.com</a>
