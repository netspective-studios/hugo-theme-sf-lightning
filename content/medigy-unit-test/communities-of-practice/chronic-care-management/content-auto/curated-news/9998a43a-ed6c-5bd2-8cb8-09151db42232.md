<p>On inpatient units at St. Mary’s General Hospital in Kitchener, discharge planning whiteboards have been replaced with 65-inch touch-screen monitors that track the journey to patient discharge in an interactive and highly-visual way. This innovative solution called stayTrack was designed by Oculys Health Informatics, of Waterloo. It was rolled out at St. Mary’s under a demonstration project which received funding from the Ontario Centres of Excellence, as well as in-kind funding from Oculys.</p><p>“This information supports the team’s discharge process by having all healthcare providers involved and informed in the patient’s plan of care,” says St. Mary’s President Don Shilton. “It helps, in a very visual way, to pinpoint any bottlenecks so those can be addressed in a timely fashion.”</p>
