<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;a new rule aiming to boost patient data exchange and streamline prior authorization to alleviate clinician burden. Additionally, the rule would allow providers to improve patient care and spend more time with their patients.&nbsp;</p><p>Completing prior authorization can be demanding for providers and lead to delays in patient care access, with 46 percent of clinicians submitting authorization requests by fax and 60 percent made over the telephone. However, electronic prior authorization is becoming more prevalent in the medical field.</p>
