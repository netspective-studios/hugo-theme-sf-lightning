<p>As workloads have skyrocketed with the massive influx of patients, hospitals have needed to improve their workflows' speed and efficiency.</p><p>Mobile technologies help healthcare teams meet these and other challenges, enabling clinicians to provide safe, sympathetic care. To optimize their efforts to deal with the pandemic's challenges and the normal hurdles of providing healthcare, hospitals and other organizations will need to continue developing their mobility programs. Even with the good news of vaccines coming available, hospitals should continue to improve their mobile capabilities to provide better care and achieve better outcomes.</p><p>As they see the value of these solutions firsthand, many healthcare providers are using them in new ways. One such use case, particularly helpful in pandemic times: deploying tablets for virtual rounding, which enables groups of doctors to interact with and evaluate patients remotely (and to confer afterward), limiting potential exposure to the virus.</p>
