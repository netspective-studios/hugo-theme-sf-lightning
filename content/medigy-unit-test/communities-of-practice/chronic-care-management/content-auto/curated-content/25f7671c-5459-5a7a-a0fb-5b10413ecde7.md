<p>As many physicians have seen fewer patients in person and expanded telehealth services amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many doctors and patients have expressed concern that the level of care may not be equal to the traditional office visit, potentially affecting the physician-patient relationship.</p><p>Reaching optimal levels of care delivery and outcomes via telemedicine is not limited to physician and care team education, Nochomovitz and Sharma stressed. "It is equally as important that we make this easy for our patients," Sharma said. "Patients don't want to download multiple applications. We have to make it easy. We have to make sure that it's also available in multiple languages."</p><p>Preparing patients for a virtual visit is one of the most important aspects of virtual care. "You should have certain guidelines and key tips that patients should read" before a visit, Sharma added.&nbsp;</p>
