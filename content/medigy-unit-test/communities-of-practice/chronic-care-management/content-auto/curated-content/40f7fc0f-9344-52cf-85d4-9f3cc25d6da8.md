<p>Capabilities like robotic process automation (RPA), for example, provide access to any capability or data that a human would have access to inside the EHR and make it accessible to software. RPA enables health systems to extend the capabilities of the FHIR application programming interfaces that many EHR vendors have provided while accelerating adoption by providing an additional path to work with data in the EHR.</p><p>In healthcare, RPA streamlines administrative workflows and improves the patient experience by surfacing previously inaccessible data to enable more personalized care.</p><p>As healthcare leaders evaluate their digital infrastructure and future investments in the COVID-19 era, extending the EHR through intelligent automation can power a variety of strategic initiatives, from attracting more patients to increasing staff and clinician capacity.</p>
