<p>Ambient intelligence refers to the combination of IoT sensors, sensor networks, and human-computer interaction (HCI) technologies powered by Pervasive-Ubiquitous Computing, big data, and artificial intelligence frameworks. This technology paves the way to a futuristic world where sensors embedded in everyday use devices will create an intelligent environment that adapts to the userâ€™s needs and wishes seamlessly.</p><p>In the healthcare arena, it can help by recording patient health stats (with patient permission) and update the patient Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to provide a better and more accurate narrative. It can aid health care workers such as physicians and nurses in delivering quality care by analyzing patient information like prior treatments, allergic responses of the patient, and more. Overall, employing this technology will enrich patient experience, physician satisfaction, and quality of care.</p>
