Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a small percentage of all physician visits were conducted via telehealth. In contrast, as of early May, telehealth surged upwards of 50% to 90% in some areas and with some specialty physicians, including primary care. And it appears this shift is not temporary. It is widely believed the pandemic is a tipping point for telemedicine, and that the new demand for telehealth services will persist well into the future.

With telehealth services, proper implementation is critical. Fortunately, the planning process is relatively straightforward, comprising the five essential steps. As with any business strategy, alignment among key stakeholders is important. The planning process should start with the formation of a telehealth committee, including business, office staff, clinical leaders (and patient for feedback, if necessary).
