<p>Over the past year, healthcare organizations have faced a rising trend of attempted and successful cyberattacks, infiltrating their information technology systems and stealing vast amounts of an employee or patient information.</p><p>Worse yet, some organizations had malware or ransomware inserted into their information systems, freezing their entire IT infrastructure until the organization either paid a ransom to an anonymous attacker or reconstructed its entire system.</p><p>The new year might be an ideal time to review other basic security measures, such as creating stronger passwords, and ensuring that users with the highest levels of access to network drives (e.g., administrators, the chief financial officer, physician-owners) are taking proper precautions with their digital footprints.</p>
