<p>Every time a prescriber writes a prescription, she taps a prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) if it is available at her health organization. The&nbsp;PDMP&nbsp;assembles pharmacy and patient data through a more extensive, state-run electronic database about controlled substances and prescription drugs from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).&nbsp;</p><p>But while integrating the PDMP is becoming a common practice, there remains room for increased PDMP integration throughout health organizations. Connecting a PDMP to an EHR system might sound difficult, but there are specific vendors and tools that&nbsp;streamline the process&nbsp;in a few easy steps.</p>
