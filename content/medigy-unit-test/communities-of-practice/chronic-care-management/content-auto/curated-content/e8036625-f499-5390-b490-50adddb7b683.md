<p>The surge in telehealth brought on by COVID-19 catalyzed an era of care distribution and decentralization powered by care delivered outside the traditional healthcare facility.</p><p>Business models that build on this momentum will require new payment and regulatory operating models and a frictionless experience for patients.</p><p>There's also going to be a sort of payer-driven market, but that payer-driven market will be probably with more risk shifted to the actual health systems. What that means is we're actually going to finally see some movement toward risk for providers, which has happened in fits and starts. A lot of systems exist in mixed or still largely fee-for-service environment, despite the fact that we've been talking about risk and value-based care for so many years.</p>
