<p>As healthcare providers look to launch or expand their telehealth networks, a key ingredient to success and sustainability is a staff that knows how to use the technology.</p><p>A telehealth bill introduced earlier this month by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo includes the launch of an open-access continuing professional education telehealth training program. The program, developed by the Reimagine New York Commission with help from, among others, the Northeast Telehealth Resource Center, Stony Brook Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, and Cityblock Health, is among the first of its kind and could be a model for telehealth training efforts across the country.</p><p>The federally funded program is unique in part because of its participants â€“ a mixture of state agencies, health systems, and NETRC, part of the National Consortium of Telehealth Resource Centers.&nbsp;</p>
