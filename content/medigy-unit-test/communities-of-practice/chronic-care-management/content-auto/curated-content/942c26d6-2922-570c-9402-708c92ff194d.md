<p>According to the report, 4 in 5 patients end up confused or frustrated when paying for healthcare services, and they blame both providers and health insurers, signaling that it’s time for tech adoption that is more patient-centric.</p><p>By utilizing self-service tools, patients can understand each line item in their bill and have the ability to pay it on time without the help of a revenue cycle management (RCM) team member. Twenty-five percent of RCM team members already complain about having too many manual processes to collect and process payments, so giving patients access to a self-service portal streamlines the process overall. This portal also ensures that patients pay their bills promptly and are not limited to only paying via phone during regular business hours.</p>
