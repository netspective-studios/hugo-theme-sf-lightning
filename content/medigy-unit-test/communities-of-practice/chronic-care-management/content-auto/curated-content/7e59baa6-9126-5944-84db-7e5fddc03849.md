<p>Before COVID-19, fewer than 1 percent of Providence patients were using virtual platforms for visits — yet that number grew to more than 60 percent during the first wave of COVID-19, Vaezy said. Nearly 80 percent of that group had never tried telehealth in any form.</p><p>That’s why providers must strive to create a positive first impression, even as telehealth plans and infrastructures evolve in real-time. Delivering a safe, seamless experience is key to building patient trust and sustaining demand for virtual care.</p><p>This involves preappointment outreach, simple instructions for getting connected, and a robust online platform to guide the steps that precede and follow a telehealth visit.</p>
