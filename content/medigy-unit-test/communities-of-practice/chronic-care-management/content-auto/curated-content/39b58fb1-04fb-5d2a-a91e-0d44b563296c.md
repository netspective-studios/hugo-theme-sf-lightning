<p>Collecting the data necessary to make informed supply and demand decisions often means going beyond the data obtained internally, within hospitals. For example, this information would need to come from third-party actors such as logistics companies, manufacturers, and government agencies. When an organization has integrated data as a culture, there is a widespread understanding of the necessity of this data to power decisions.</p><p>These healthcare leaders have laid the crucial foundations by investing in data warehouses, data lakes, data transformation, and data cleaning.</p><p>The primary challenge they face at this moment is driving data value. To achieve this, healthcare IT professionals must create a data infrastructure where multiple analytical models are run on past historical data with minimal latency. This is also providing an intuitive user experience to healthcare users and an environment where decisions are driven by local teams working within a data culture.</p>
