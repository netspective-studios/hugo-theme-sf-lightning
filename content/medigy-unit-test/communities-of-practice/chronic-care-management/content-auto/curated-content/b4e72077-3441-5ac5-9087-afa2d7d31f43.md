<p>Before the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic, in-person care was the primary healthcare delivery model in the United States. But rising&nbsp;COVID-19 infection rates&nbsp;required healthcare providers to transition to virtual care. This industry-wide transition has spurred a&nbsp;massive increase in telehealth claims. According to Definitive Healthcare data,&nbsp;2020 telehealth claims&nbsp;are almost 18 times higher than they were in 2019. The rapid adoption of telehealth technologies raises several important questions:</p><ul><li>Why has it taken so long for the healthcare industry to move forward with telehealth?</li><li>How has telehealth changed physicians’ day-to-day workflows?</li><li>Will telehealth regulations change after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides?</li></ul>
