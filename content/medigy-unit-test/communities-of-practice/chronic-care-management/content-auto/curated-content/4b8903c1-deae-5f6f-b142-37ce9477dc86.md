<p>While the healthcare community has since rightly shifted from focusing on HHS’ rules to battling COVID-19, the pandemic has underscored the need and value for the industry to advance interoperability and make better use of real-time data in the delivery of care.</p><p>There’s more to interoperability than just exchanging data between medical devices and systems; true interoperability enables a significant reduction in medical errors and empowers clinicians to make more well-informed decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s important to understand that interoperability is a journey, not a destination and its progress depends on three important factors, according to the Center for Connected Medicine’s interoperability survey:</p><ul><li>Commitment by senior leadership;&nbsp;</li><li>Financial incentives that encourage organizations to share data with one another and with individual patients (with penalties for not doing so); and&nbsp;</li><li>Advances in tools and technologies.&nbsp;</li></ul>
