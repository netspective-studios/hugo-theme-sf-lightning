<p>The healthcare industry, like many others, has become a data-driven industry collecting data from patients, doctors, labs, and payers that are all crucial to patient healthcare diagnosis and outcome. When it comes to research, data can be useful in creating emerging healthcare technological innovations, pharmaceutical discoveries, as well as other advances in the market, but it also is accompanied by strong regulatory compliance, like stringent HIPAA laws, that dictate that this data is kept private and secure.</p><p>Healthcare organizations understand how crucial data is; however, they have yet to understand the value of a robust, unified approach to data management that provides an organization with a single view of metadata across all business intelligence systems used in the healthcare organization so that accessibility is simple, errors can be detected immediately, and data lineage can be traced in seconds.</p>
