<p>The healthcare industry has been hesitant to adopt cloud solutions- asking tough questions about return on investment, security, and data governance. As we peek ahead to 2021, we see significant momentum and interest in the cloud.</p><p>Both public and private cloud technology continue to mature, making the transition to cloud more predictable. The breadth of offerings makes it easier to manage and deploy cloud services. Public cloud providers have made significant investments in healthcare-specific capabilities. Beyond technology, strategic planning is often the most important step in gaining value from the cloud long term. Key components of the planning effort include determining organizational goals, committing resources, understanding the build components, and identifying appropriate cloud partners. With a robust strategy and leadership commitment, cloud services can deliver value across both clinical and business systems.</p>
