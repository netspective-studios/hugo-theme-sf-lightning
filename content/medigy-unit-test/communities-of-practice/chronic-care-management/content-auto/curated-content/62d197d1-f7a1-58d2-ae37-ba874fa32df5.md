<p>United Methodist faced two different problems: One was falls in its skilled nursing environment, and the other was effective telehealth visits for residents.</p><p>Skilled nursing facilities take care of the frailest of the countryâ€™s elders. United Methodist wanted a way to keep its residents safe and protect them from falls, which can have dire consequences for this population. The other problem it was looking to solve was inefficient telehealth visits.</p><p>This may not sound like a tremendous burden; however, many older adults have hearing issues, vision problems, and difficulties with projecting their voices. There also are limitations on the clinical information a physician can acquire. Laptops and iPads do not have specialty diagnostic equipment to aid the clinician.</p>
