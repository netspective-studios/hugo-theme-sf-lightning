<p>Healthcare consumerism has been a trend on the rise for many years but has never been more relevant than in the COVID-19 “new normal.” Since millions of patients are dealing with financial struggles, loss of insurance, and an overall sense of apprehension when it comes to resuming care treatments, they are extremely particular about where and how they receive care.</p><p>Right now, it’s imperative for practices to make patients feel like they have control over their healthcare, which means having the right tools in place to deliver a streamlined financial experience, convenient and efficient self-service options, and transparency around pricing and financial support. To meet these demands, physician practices should leverage the expertise of a proven revenue cycle partner that has the knowledge, technology investments, and process improvement experience needed to drive next-level revenue cycle performance and exceed patient expectations.</p>
