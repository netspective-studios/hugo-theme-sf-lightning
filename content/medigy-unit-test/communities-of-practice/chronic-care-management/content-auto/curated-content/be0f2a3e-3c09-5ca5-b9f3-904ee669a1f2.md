<p>Considering how reliant we’ve become on virtual visits as a clinical tool, I decided to chat with a few of my colleagues about how telehealth might support the vaccine rollout efforts. After all, getting vaccinated still requires a patient’s physical presence in the office. And with nearly 3 million doses of approved vaccines having already been shipped across the U.S., we’re now beginning one of the greatest vaccination efforts in medical history.</p><p>What I heard confirmed my hunch: telehealth will play a critical role in managing vaccine distribution and supporting patients through a simple but potentially scary process for some.</p><p>Patient education and communication are known to increase compliance and help improve health outcomes. Telehealth will reinforce strong doctor-patient communication, all while increasing compliance. With the use of telehealth, we can continue to make the vaccine distribution process more efficient over time.</p>
