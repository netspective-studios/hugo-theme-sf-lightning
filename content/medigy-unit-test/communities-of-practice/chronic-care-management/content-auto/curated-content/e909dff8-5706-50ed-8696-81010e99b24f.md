Over the past several years, healthcare has been slowly but surely moving toward the adoption of value-based care. As the industry enters a new decade, the transition is finally picking up speed.

  

Many major payers and providers have already forged ahead with new collaborative strategies for meeting quality and spending targets. Yet, a number of independent primary care practices are still unsure about what value-based care will mean for their patients and providers – not to mention the financial sustainability of their businesses.

  

“I’m here to tell you that it’s okay to come on in – the water’s warm,” said Farzad Mostashari, MD, CEO and Co-founder of Aledade. “And if you’re already dipping your toes in, you can put your whole foot in and come deeper. Value-based care is different than what you’re used to, but it can be a truly meaningful and sustainable alternative for fee-for-service.”
