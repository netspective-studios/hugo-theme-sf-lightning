<p>To stay relevant and survive in the industry, independent physicians must invest in compliant, data-sharing technologies to improve their practices. There are several reasons why independent physicians may be slower to adopt new technologies, including cost and regulations. Perceived lack of incentives may discourage both smaller and larger practices from investing in this component of their business. However, these technological investments ultimately feed the patient experience, revenue cycle, revenue capture, and overall efficiencies that support a value-based health care model.</p><p>As practices consider how best to navigate the environment of value-based and accountable care, some will consider affiliations with other providers and health systems. These affiliations may broaden a practiceâ€™s reputation and reach but put additional pressure on limited resources to navigate health system policies, procedures, and IT requirements.</p>
