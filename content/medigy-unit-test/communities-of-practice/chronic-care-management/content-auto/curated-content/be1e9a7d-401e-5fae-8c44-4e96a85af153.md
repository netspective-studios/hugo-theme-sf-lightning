<p>Alternative payment models that use population-based payments to incent providers to deliver coordinated, high quality, person-centered care are key to building healthcare system resiliency after a crisis like COVID-19, according to the Health Care Payment Learning &amp; Action Network (LAN).</p><p>The new framework report provides steps payers and providers can take to promote more resilient, effective APMs. The steps include transitioning to effective APMs, promoting health equity, calibrating model participation to account for varying provider needs, and advancing whole-person care through increased clinical integration.</p><p>Industry experts at the LAN Summit shared how their organizations are already engaging in the steps identified in the framework report and how their APMs are helping them continue the value-based reimbursement transition after COVID-19.</p>
