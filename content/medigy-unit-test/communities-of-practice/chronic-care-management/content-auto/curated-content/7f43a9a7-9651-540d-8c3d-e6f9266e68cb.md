<p>The technology for managing and utilizing healthcare data is already widely available and improving quickly. Now,&nbsp;new rulings&nbsp;by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) have expanded patient data access to providers, payers, third-party vendors and patients themselves. This will turbo-charge data sharing, care coordination and consumerism while leading to an explosion of new products and services.</p><p>To compete effectively in this age of liquid data, traditional healthcare organizations will need to step up their technological capabilities and adopt a new mindset. That starts with developing the systems and capacity to aggregate, store, standardize and protect massive data sets.</p>
