Only one health provider who assumes the care management role for a beneficiary can bill for providing CCM services to that patient in a given calendar month. While services are provided by a clinical staff person, the service must be billed under one of the following:

*   Physician
*   Clinical nurse specialist (CNS)
*   Nurse practitioner (NP)
*   Physician assistant (PA)
*   Certified nurse midwife

Non-physicians must legally be authorized and qualified to provide CCM in the state in which the services are furnished.

Chronic care management can help manage your patientsâ€™ chronic conditions more effectively, improve communication among other treating clinicians, and provide a way to optimize revenue for your practice. Learn how time spent coordinating referrals, refilling prescriptions, and taking calls or emails from patients and caregivers can contribute towards the required time to bill CCM.
