<p>As innovative disrupters enter the healthcare market, today’s average consumer has many options for where and how to obtain healthcare services. That’s because today’s healthcare consumers shop for providers in ways very similar to how they shop for other products and services. They begin their search online, creating a list of potential providers and then working through the list to choose one based on criteria that often includes whether the provider accepts their health insurance, recommendations from others, ratings, convenience, location, availability and more.</p><p>To make sure that your health system not only makes consumers’ short list, but also converts these shoppers into new patients, you need a strong digital marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p>
