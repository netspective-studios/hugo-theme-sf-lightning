<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has put serious pressure on healthcare IT teams — with challenges that include supporting work-from-home staffers, coping with limited resources and budgets, and handling a flood of new clinical data.</p><p>As organizations address these changes, they must make security a top priority.</p><p>An abrupt shift to remote work has led to massive migrations of workloads to the cloud. The speed of this move sometimes resulted in mistakes, which created unexpected vulnerabilities. Further exacerbating the situation is that cybercriminals have taken advantage of the situation by increasing the volume and sophistication.</p><p>A comprehensive and agile security plan can meet these threats head-on. Healthcare organizations that adopt an approach of security by design will reduce mistakes and improve the effectiveness of their defenses.&nbsp;</p>
