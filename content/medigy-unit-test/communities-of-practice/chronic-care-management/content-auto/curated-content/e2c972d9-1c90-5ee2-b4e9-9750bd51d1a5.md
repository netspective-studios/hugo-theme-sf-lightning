In 2017, CMS relaxed some of the regulations in terms of documentation requirements; these changes were meant to encourage providers to begin offering chronic care services. Physicians had been discouraged from providing CCM services because of the complicated billing rules. Despite the revisions made to CCM documentation requirements, billing for CCM services remains problematic.

This article will focus on the documentation requirements for billing CCM services, how to avoid denials, and how to stay in compliance with CCM regulation and documentation requirements. Compliance officers may also consider this as a potential risk area and integrate it into their auditing and monitoring plans.
