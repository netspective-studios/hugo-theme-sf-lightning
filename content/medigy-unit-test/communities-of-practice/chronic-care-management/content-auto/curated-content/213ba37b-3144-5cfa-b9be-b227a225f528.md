Healthcare organizations must redesign their systems of care to better address the needs of their patients with depression, asthma, diabetes, and other chronic conditions. America’s safety net providers have led the way. Today, 10 years after the development of the Chronic Care Model and the initial implementation of the Health Disparities Collaboratives, the lessons learned, tools developed, and strategies used by these vanguard teams provide the foundation for the next wave of improvement in chronic illness care. 

The toolkit provides a step-by-step practical approach to guide teams through quality improvement. A companion Practice Coaching Manual that outlines our approach and provides orientation to other national efforts is also available.
