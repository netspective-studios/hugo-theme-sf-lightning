<p>AI-enabled EHR technology has become especially beneficial during COVID-19, as physicians are now tasked with engaging a growing patient population virtually. This is partly because virtual solutions have yet to find a way to replicate the triage process, which can introduce data concerns without proper technology. During triage, patients speak with the administrator, nurse, and doctor—all of whom collect data independently. But rather than speaking with admins and nurses, telehealth patients are immediately connected to the provider.</p><p>Telemedicine was initially created for low acuity care, but it didn’t receive widespread adoption until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the technology was stagnant for decades, telemedicine has now become a critical component for managing cough, cold, flu and more. To address a growing patient population with dwindling provider availability, AI is helping to bridge the gap between patient need and provider time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
