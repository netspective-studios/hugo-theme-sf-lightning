<p>There is no doubt that robust data analytics are critical to managing rising healthcare costs and clinical outcomes. Analytics gives you a deep understanding of where your member population stands today. But the true utility of analytics lies in the ability to answer your next questions: Why are these trends happening, and what should I do about it?</p><p>Predictive analytics identify patterns in your data to help you understand what will likely happen to your members in the future.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>You already know that half of those patients treated for heart failure return to a hospital within six months. What you need to know next: Which of your members are at greatest risk for readmission?</li><li>You know, a third of drug prescriptions go unfilled. What you need to know next: Which members forego medication and other types of careâ€”and how does this affect their health status?</li></ul>
