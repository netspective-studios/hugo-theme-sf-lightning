<p>&nbsp;Healthcare has finally seen its strong use case for the patient portal during the COVID-19 crisis, with patients and healthcare providers alike leaning on the technology to coordinate healthcare during the pandemic.</p><p>Most successful vaccination efforts utilized patient portals and other forms of digital communication, such as virtual patient education materials focused on the importance of receiving a vaccination and the safety and efficacy of a certain shot. Additionally, the ability to schedule a vaccination appointment via the patient portal improved the odds a patient would actually get her shot.</p><p>But moving beyond that, enabling patient data access will require organizations to deliver vaccine appointment scheduling, clear communication about what to do at an appointment, simple messaging about receiving a follow-up vaccine, and an intuitive way for patients to document vaccine receipt.</p>
