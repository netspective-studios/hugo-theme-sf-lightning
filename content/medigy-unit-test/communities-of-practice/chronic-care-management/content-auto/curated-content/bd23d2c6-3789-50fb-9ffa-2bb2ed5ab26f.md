<p>Interoperability in healthcare is at an inflection point. Great progress has been made, but many challenges remain that limit stakeholders’ ability to fully optimize the delivery of quality, value-based care while also reducing costs. Major FHIR®-centric initiatives have emerged to address these barriers and allow healthcare to embrace interoperability that has fueled innovation and disruption in other industries.</p><p>The HL7® Da Vinci Project and ONC’s FHIR at Scale Task Force (FAST) are two initiatives leveraging FHIR to liberate data in support of value-based care and promote scalable adoption. Through cross-industry, consensus-based effort, these initiatives create essential use cases, guidelines, and implementation guides—with the goal of removing barriers to FHIR scalability.</p>
