<p>Having become quite popular over the years, mobile healthcare seems to be entering a plateau. With the oversaturated market and top usage attributed to wealthier consumers, mHealth devices and apps still need to be embraced more systematically to reach patients and augment traditional care meaningfully.</p><p>As we can see, bringing patients to reconsider mHealth tools is a tough but manageable task. It requires a good understanding of your patients’ needs and technological preferences. But this is not all it takes. It also requires a fair share of creativity and inventiveness—you need to choose an approach that covers patients’ requirements in an engaging way and also helps to keep the right balance between the efforts, costs, and payoff.</p>
