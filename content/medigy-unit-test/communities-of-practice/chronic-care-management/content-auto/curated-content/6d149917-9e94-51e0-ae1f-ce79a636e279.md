<p>Current care delivery is, for the most part, conducted on an episodic basis. Patients generally see their doctors when they don't feel well, limiting clinicians' ability to provide holistic, comprehensive care.</p><p>To further enhance the care experience and improve the relationship between patients and clinicians, Highmark Health recently announced a six-year partnership with Google Cloud to build and maintain the Living Health model's innovation engine.</p><p>The agreement includes the development of the Living Health Dynamic Platform, which will work to overcome complexities and fragmentation in the healthcare industry.</p><p>“There's a fair amount of fragmentation in healthcare today, and it can be a frustrating process to navigate.
