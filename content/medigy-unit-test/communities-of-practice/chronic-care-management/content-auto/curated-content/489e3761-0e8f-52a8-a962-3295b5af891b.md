The COVID-19 pandemic has reached a point where hospitals have to triage patients, so the need for telehealth solutions such as remote patient monitoring (RPM) has become more pressing than everâ€”especially for the care of high-risk individuals. Since the geriatric population and immunocompromised individuals are most at risk for virus transmissions, caregivers are now rapidly shifting their focus to digital healthcare technologies to ensure a wider number of these patients receive an optimum level of care, without the risk of COVID-19 transmission in clinical settings.
