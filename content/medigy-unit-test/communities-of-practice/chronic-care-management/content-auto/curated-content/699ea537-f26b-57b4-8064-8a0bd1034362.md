<p>Digital is no longer a differentiator for healthcare organizations. In order to stay competitive and address a host of new challenges, providers must consistently adopt and embrace new technologies to improve workflows and enhance patient care. By redefining their care process and the ways providers make themselves available, patients are a driving force for much of this change.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to deliver and sustain a new level of care, providers must evolve their thinking and current operating processes. Utilizing these and other technologies not only will help meet the changing expectations of healthcare consumers but also drive improved care when itâ€™s needed most.</p>
