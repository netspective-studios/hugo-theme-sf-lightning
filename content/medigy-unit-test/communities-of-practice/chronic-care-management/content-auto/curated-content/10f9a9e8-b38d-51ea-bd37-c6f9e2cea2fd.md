<p>Covid-19 has sparked a new normal in health care delivery, particularly among group medical practices treating thousands of patients a week. As a result, leaders at virtually every such practice in the United States must rethink their daily operations for the long-term. Sharp Rees-Stealy Medical Group is taking this journey, and it will never operate in the same way again.</p><p>Some changes made in the moment of heightened Covid-19 infections will be adopted and adapted for the long-term. Changes include redesigned physical ingress and egress for patients and employees, as well as major redeployments and retraining of staff and a new approach to patient encounters, including the integration of virtual visits as a regular mode of care, plus increased focus on social determinants.</p>
