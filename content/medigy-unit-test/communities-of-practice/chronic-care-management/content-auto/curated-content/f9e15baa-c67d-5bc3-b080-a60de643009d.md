<p>Financial models for every industry right now are adapting overnight. Consider other industries’ subscription models – movies, music, and software. Consumers pay to avoid the hassle of storing or maintaining the asset on demand. Now, apply this thought process to the healthcare realm, specifically a healthcare organization’s data foundation. Healthcare IT leaders could pay for an experience without having to worry about maintenance or future technology refreshes.</p><p>Over the past decade, the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has accelerated exponentially, in part by government incentives and requirements. This shift has shown health organizations the potential to use data to innovate, including advancements in telemedicine, artificial intelligence, predictive medicine, and so much more. But all of this requires organizations to redefine how they consume and pay for data storage, with a close eye on disruptive technologies, data growth, the cloud, and total cost of ownership.</p>
