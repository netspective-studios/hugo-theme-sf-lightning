<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted gaps in our healthcare system but also illuminated opportunities for clinics and systems to build deeper relationships with existing and new patients and drive lifetime value. For example, the stark decline in the number of Americans with primary care doctors is down by millions.</p><p>The challenge comes not just from the presence of these easy-to-access clinics but also from retail leveraging engagement technology and tools for years. They understand how to build long-term relationships that create loyalty and unlock lifetime value. They use data and digital channels to drive proactive engagement.</p><p>A successful data-driven strategy must be designed from end-to-end and personalized to every customer. Practitioners must go beyond asking whether or not they can implement the technical details of an approach (whether it’s a rules-based or ML model) and start by thinking about how best to serve their customers/patients.</p>
