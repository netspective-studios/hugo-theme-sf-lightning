<p>As health plans move towards quality over quantity-based reimbursement models, they are under immense pressure to ingest and operationalize new datasets to properly inform and pay the providers that have transitioned to VBC contractual arrangements. If health plans do not better align their data management, payment management, and reporting execution capabilities to enable their VBC contractual arrangements, they run the risk of antagonizing or even losing providers – which will torpedo even the best strategy.</p><p>To avoid this outcome, health plans need to retool their VBC execution capabilities to ensure swift provider buy-in and include sustainable access to valuable and actionable data. This lofty goal goes well beyond the triple aim to what I’m now calling the quest for the “healthcare holy grail.”</p>
