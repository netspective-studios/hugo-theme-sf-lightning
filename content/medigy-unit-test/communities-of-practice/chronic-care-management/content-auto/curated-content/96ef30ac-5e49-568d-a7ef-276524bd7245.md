<p>In the complex world of patient care delivery, “cloud” can mean anything from public cloud to private cloud on-premise and everything in-between. Different workloads call for different solutions – e.g., the latency and service delivery requirements for advanced medical imaging is vastly different from that of modern EMR databases. As a result, most organizations operate in multiple clouds – experiencing amplified complexity and risks due to the resultant disparate tools and security postures.</p><p>In today’s environment, healthcare providers need agility for changing business and clinical requirements and tools to map when and where their data and applications should reside on the cloud to provide a consistent experience for end-users.</p>
