<p>More than three years have passed since the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced its separately billable non-face-to-face&nbsp;Chronic Care Management (CCM) service. The hope was that a focus on managing chronic conditions would contribute to better outcomes for overall&nbsp;population health, improve individual access to care, and increase patient satisfaction.</p><p>The hypothesis was right. But, as it turns out, CCM also is delivering benefits to providers and payers. If you are interested in exploring how CCM can help improve your patients’ lives and boost practice revenue, the first step is to develop a top-down strategy at the organizational level.</p>
