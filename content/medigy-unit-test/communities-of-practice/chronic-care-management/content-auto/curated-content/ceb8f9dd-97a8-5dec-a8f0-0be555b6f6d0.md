<p>Health plans have been working to optimize their performance with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Star Rating Program for years.

For measure-level score prediction, a regression paradigm is recommended with features that capture the essence of a contract’s historical performance and other details about the plan. For cut-point projection, there are a few possible options. One involves predicting all contracts for the upcoming year and replicating CMS’s cut-point calculation methodology.</p>
