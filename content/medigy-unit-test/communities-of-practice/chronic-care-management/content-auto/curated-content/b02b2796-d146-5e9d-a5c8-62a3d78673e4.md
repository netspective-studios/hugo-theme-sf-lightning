<p>Revenue cycle directors see a clear path for automation to increase revenue, decrease denials, speed up prior authorization and claims, and remove many of the repetitive clicks that hamper daily operations.</p><p>From an ROI perspective, automation saves money through fewer full-time equivalent positions.</p><p>Three revenue cycle executives interviewed, who are at different stages of revenue cycle automation in their health systems, said the savings had not been achieved through layoffs, but through attrition and employees being trained for jobs machines and even smart AI processes, can't do.</p><p>Another automation that came about a year-and-a-half ago is the Healthcare Extensibility Platform, or HEP, which, unlike an emulator, works behind the scenes in real-time to get a claim paid. It's a Cerner product that fits with the health system's EHR Cerner system.</p>
