<p>Virtual care is now essential to modern medicine. This shift has been astoundingly rapid: In a single week,&nbsp;Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford&nbsp;saw its daily number of virtual outpatient visits jump from 20 to 400. Kadambari Beelwar, the California hospital’s telehealth manager,&nbsp;tells HealthTech&nbsp;that the number of visits surpassed 600 soon after that.</p><p>“Clinicians have been thrust into taking a history, performing physical exams and generating differential diagnoses using telehealth without any proper training or competency, or maybe even touching the equipment,” Ann Fronczek said in a webinar panel as part of the&nbsp;American Telemedicine Association’s 2020 conference.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s time that organizations focus on the people who will truly make virtual care work.</p>
