<p>Of patients who like using telehealth services, 65% say it's because telehealth visits are more convenient than in-office appointments, and 63% say it’s because they don’t have to worry about being exposed to other potentially sick patients. Americans who like using telehealth services also enjoy it because it’s easier to schedule an appointment via telehealth than an in-office appt (44%), and because follow-ups/communications post-appointment are more streamlined (38%).<br><br>So, convenience and safety are two themes that emerged during the COVID-19 crisis and will continue to impact consumer choice after the pandemic. Those results show us that telehealth is no longer a “plus” or “nice to have” for practices; it will become a requirement to stay in business. Virtual care and contactless offices will transform the way healthcare is provided. Today’s healthcare providers need modern, impactful ways to maximize patient engagement, improve outcomes, and enable more timely, efficient connections between patients and physicians.</p>
