<p>The goal, if possible, is to bring healthcare back to some semblance of its pre-coronavirus activity. As my colleague, Mary Lou Mangan-Lamb wrote recently: “As providers determine how to get patients to return to facilities for routine disease management and preventive screenings, opportunities are ripe for the application of analytics to triage at the right time to the right setting. Data related to COVID-19 will continue to flow rapidly, but there are possibly more questions than answers now about a return to “normal.” Health systems will have to use data to identify the patients needing immediate care when facilities re-open. The hope is predictive analytics will be used to its highest capacity to help.”</p><p>In the meantime, healthcare providers should consider bringing together current data analytics solutions, along with those created explicitly to monitor and forecast pandemic-related medical services.</p>
