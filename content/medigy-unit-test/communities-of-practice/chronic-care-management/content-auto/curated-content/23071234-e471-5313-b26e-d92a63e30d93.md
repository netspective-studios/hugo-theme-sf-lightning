<p>Making improvements in healthcare data analytics has the potential to lead to significant cost savings and improved patient health and wellness.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve identified two ways these improvements can be accomplished:</p><ol><li>Embrace an enterprise analytics strategy to process vast amounts of healthcare data, rather than historical approaches of stitching together dozens of analytics tools resulting in high IT costs and low user adoption.</li><li>Help payers and providers understand what the data means and how to act on the information.</li></ol><p>Healthcare is flooded with data produced by patients, physicians, hospitals, urgent care centers, emergency departments, and personal wearables. The amount of data created will continue to increase as time goes by, and technology advances. Healthcare organizations that don’t adapt will simply cease to exist, crushed under the weight of data, or be consumed by healthcare businesses that recognize the power of data analytics.</p>
