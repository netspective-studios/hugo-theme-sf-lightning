<p>"The use of digital technologies significantly improved the patient flow and experience, once at the vaccine clinic, and allowed us to easily gauge volume in real-time, flexing the number of available appointments up and down to reflect vaccine availability simply by opening/closing more 'appointment slots' on the website to feed the schedule," Mistretta said â€“ noting that the hospital also relied on chatbots to send appointment reminders to patients.</p><p>"Our COVID-19 vaccine tracking tool, to date, has helped close to 200,000 frontline caregivers receive the COVID-19 vaccine. We are grateful we could help and give back to frontline caregivers, and we hope the vaccine-tracking tool has made life a little easier for them," Paslick continued.&nbsp;</p>
