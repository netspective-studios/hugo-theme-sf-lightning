Health equity means all patients have the same opportunity to achieve wellness. Care quality, disease management, and genetic makeup are core parts of patient health.

From there, healthcare professionals can begin to link health equity and health disparities, working to address high-risk patients and the social factors that influence their ability to live their healthiest lives possible.
