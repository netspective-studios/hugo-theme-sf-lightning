<p>It is crucial to effectively communicate the rollout process across all patient populations, bearing in mind that blanket communication does not resonate with everyone. However, the formula is the same as any other patient engagement strategy: drive patient access, action, and adherence. Health systems will likely encounter some hesitancy from patients as they are surrounded by conflicting statements about the vaccine but becoming the voice of reason will help patients decipher factual information and block out the noise. As you begin your vaccine rollout plan, consider the following elements.</p><p>Health systems must also have a strong social media presence to break through the noise and dispel misinformation that users can obtain through social postings and other media. Marketing departments canâ€™t control what is being said on Facebook groups or fringe conspiracy theory sites, for example, regarding misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
