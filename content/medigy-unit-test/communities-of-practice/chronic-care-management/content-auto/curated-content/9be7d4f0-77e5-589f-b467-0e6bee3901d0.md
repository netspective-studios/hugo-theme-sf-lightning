<p>According to research from Forrester, just one in four providers had a virtual care program in place in the weeks prior to the pandemic. In the face of rapid change, many providers are struggling to implement the necessary technology. However, when done the right way, telemedicine has huge potential for boosting patient engagement levels while improving overall health outcomes.</p><p>Modifying practice patterns and operations to support telehealth requires a very different approach to connecting with patients. It demands that organizations adjust clinical and administrative workflows to furnish a highly coordinated, highly efficient experience.</p><p>Encouraging patient participation in their care regimen through the use of technology tools to increase patient engagement. Having a dedicated patient portal within the telemedicine platform can prove to be instrumental to this end. The patientâ€™s medical history, chief complaint, medication history, etc., can be recorded when the patient schedules the appointment.</p>
