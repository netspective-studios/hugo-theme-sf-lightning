Crisis situations often unveil the true strength of relationships between healthcare stakeholders. Amid heightened concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers have naturally looked to their healthcare providers and payer partners to help keep them safe, healthy, and informed.

The importance of leveraging a proactive patient engagement strategy cannot be underestimated, as staying healthy—and avoiding health risks—directly impacts quality outcomes.

Physicians are often overworked and typically don’t have the time to develop relationships with patients as meaningfully as they would like to or allocate more than 15 minutes for acute care visits.
