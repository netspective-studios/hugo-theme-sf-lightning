<p>Fostering a positive financial experience for patients – and thereby capturing a more steady stream of revenue – is critical as healthcare organizations deal with the financial uncertainty created by COVID-19 and other industry forces. In that context, picking an appropriate vendor partner becomes critically important, and requires insight into the market for patient financial engagement platforms.</p><p>A new KLAS report attempts to shed some light on that market. Several factors have to work together to deliver a clear path to financial resolution.</p><p>Among those factors are intelligent interactive voice response and email communication from the vendor denoting a patient's responsibility. KLAS' goal was to provide a comprehensive analysis of these vendors and their relative strengths and weaknesses.</p>
