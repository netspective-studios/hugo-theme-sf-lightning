<p>For many providers, the end of the pandemic is in sight with the recent emergency use authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine. And while this may be true, it is just the start of a COVID-19 vaccine billing and coding strategy for healthcare organizations.</p><p>The US government has already started shipping doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to healthcare organizations across the country, and federal leaders expect to send more government-acquired doses as they become available and as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves more vaccines for emergency use.</p><p>While providers generally cannot bill payers for vaccine doses they receive for free, providers will be able to submit claims for the administration of the vaccine and, eventually, doses it purchases from drug manufacturers.</p>
