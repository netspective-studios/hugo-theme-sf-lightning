The vast majority of primary care physicians don’t have the time or tools to adequately address the needs of their patients with multiple chronic conditions, leaving some patients to struggle with health-related social and behavioral issues on their own, according to new research from Quest Diagnostics.

The findings are based on an independent survey commissioned by Quest of primary care physicians (PCPs) and adult patients 65 years and older who have multiple chronic conditions and are Medicare beneficiaries. Quest commissioned the study to uncover insights into gaps in care for older patients with chronic conditions, and opportunities to better manage these populations with Chronic Care Management and related services.
