<p>Healthcare practices may be open, but it’s not business as usual. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the way the world thinks and acts, and this is especially relevant in healthcare. Most practices&nbsp;stayed open&nbsp;but may have had to lay off non-essential staff due to decreased patient volume. Others increased virtual care, while all have had to rethink how they will conduct business to survive financially after the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>The new normal of patient care has arrived with additional challenges for healthcare practices. Financially surviving the COVID-19 pandemic may require changes such as a shift in patient care provision, and increasing automation and options for virtual care.</p>
