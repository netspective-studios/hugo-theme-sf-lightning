<p>To start with, MFA will ask a user-specific question after an attempted login, and the answer is typically not something hackers can generate on their own, making it a very effective tool for protecting data, even if the attacker has compromised user credentials.</p><p>Without MFA, healthcare organizationsâ€™ data is at high risk of hacking. Particularly during the coronavirus pandemic, credential theft activity has surged, and the costs of getting hacked are only increasing.</p><p>Nevertheless, with such high stakes, providers are still stalled at the same percentage of conformity to national security standards as last year, with less than half of them in compliance with the NIST security framework standard.</p><p>This enables them to invent complex, protective passwords without the fear of forgetting the password, as the passwords are managed directly on the workstation.</p>
