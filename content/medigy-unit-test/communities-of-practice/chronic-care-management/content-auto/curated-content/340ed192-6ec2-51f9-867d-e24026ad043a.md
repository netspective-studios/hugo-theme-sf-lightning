<p>Providers around the country are grappling with administering the vaccine amid several hurdles. These include coordinating with state agencies and ensuring equitable administration of the vaccine. As with other pandemic challenges, many providers are leveraging technology and IT solutions to help them achieve their vaccine administration goals.</p><p>To provide additional support for those individuals who cannot access the internet or have trouble navigating the webpage, Intermountain has set up a centralized call center. Call center workers will help them generate the VaxPass and reserve an arrival window to get the vaccine. In this case, the patient can arrive without the VaxPass, and health system employees will be able to pull it up for them, Haberle said.</p><p>To curb hesitancy, most providers are relying on communicating directly with patients to dispel rumors and increase confidence in the vaccine.</p>
