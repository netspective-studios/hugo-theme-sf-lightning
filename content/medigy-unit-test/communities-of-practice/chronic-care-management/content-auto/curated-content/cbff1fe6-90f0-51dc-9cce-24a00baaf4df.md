<p>A cash flow forecast is a crucial part of decision making in the same way checking the weather report in the morning is part of preparing for the day ahead. Cash flow forecasts do need to be more reliable than the weatherperson, but the reason you’d check with either forecast is very similar: you want to know what action to take in the present to ensure the highest probability of comfort and preparedness in the future.</p><p>Businesses want to know how to succeed financially and if financial professionals can provide an effective, actionable forecast it’s inarguably of huge value to new businesses and larger companies alike.</p>
