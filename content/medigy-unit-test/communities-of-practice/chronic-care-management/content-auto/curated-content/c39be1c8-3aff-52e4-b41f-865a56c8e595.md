<p>Many patients avoided trips to their providers amid fears of exposure to COVID-19, uncertainty about how to access care, and shutdowns across several US states. Now, medical providers are working hard to bridge the resulting gaps in care, so their patients aren’t at risk for complications and adverse outcomes.</p><p>Hybrid care delivery is helping medical providers ramp back up quickly and get their patients seen and treated using a combination of in-office and Telehealth visits. With the flexibility to meet a wide variety of patient needs and preference, hybrid care delivery means patients who aren’t yet comfortable visiting a clinic in person or who grew to prefer telehealth can still access the care they need while patients who need an in-person exam or procedure can access care as well. But with hybrid care comes the challenge of identifying workflows that can accommodate both appointment types.</p>
