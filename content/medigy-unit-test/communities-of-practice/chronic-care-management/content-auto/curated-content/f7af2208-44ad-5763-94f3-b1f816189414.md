<p>It’s an understatement to say the pandemic accentuated the importance of data’s role in healthcare. For more than a decade, our industry has been inching toward fully automating its business processes to improve efficiency and eliminate waste. The shift to a value-based care model has put even greater emphasis on data to help healthcare finally understand the true cost of delivering care, including the cost of supplies, anticipated patient outcomes, and how to reduce unwarranted clinical variation.</p><p>The push to improve efficiency, reduce costs and understand the true cost of care are the drivers of recent investments in electronic health records (EHR), enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and digitizing supply chains. The next step in healthcare’s technological transformation is the integration of these IT systems to support a clinically integrated supply chain.</p>
