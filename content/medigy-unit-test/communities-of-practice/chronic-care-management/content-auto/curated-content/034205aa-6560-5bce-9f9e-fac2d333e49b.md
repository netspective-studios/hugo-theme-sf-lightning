<p>One ongoing hurdle will be educating and informing patients when the vaccine is available to them and then scheduling both doses and ensuring patients show up. At the same time, providers need to be thinking about getting patients to come in for much-needed care after staying away from the doctorâ€™s office last year. And they need to do it knowing that about 60% of patients still expect at least some of their care to be virtual.</p><p>To pull all this off, providers should consider a new strategy for their scheduling and pre-appointment workflow. To operate more efficiently as an organization and fill up the appointment schedule, it will be critical to creating a single workflow that supports both in-person and telehealth visits.</p><p>Automating as much as possible of the patient scheduling communications saves time and helps with planning, ensuring the organization knows who has confirmed, canceled and rescheduled.</p>
