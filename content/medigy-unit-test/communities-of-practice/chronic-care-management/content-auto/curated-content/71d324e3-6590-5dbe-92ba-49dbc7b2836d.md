Once the patient completed the screening, a care team member, usually a medical assistant, would transcribe the form into the health record. Integration between the EHR and the SDOH software would produce a tailored list of resources.

But as Zuehlke noted, COVID-19 took over the healthcare industry in March, pushing many organizations like Allina to **close** its primary care and other non-emergent healthcare facilities. And like many others in the industry, Allina filled care access gaps using telehealth to help maintain care management for patients.

When front desk staffers issue an SDOH screening to a patient, they have the opportunity to explain why the clinic is collecting this information and how providers can use it to improve the patient’s health and wellbeing. This practice is essential for building **patient trust**, which in turn is key for patients disclosing their greatest social and personal needs.
