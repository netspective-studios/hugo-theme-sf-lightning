<p>Determining how to best leverage the workforce can be a daunting task. However, an emphasis on staffing is an excellent place to begin building a comprehensive workforce management strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Every organization is different, so any strategy should be tailored to meet that hospital or health system’s unique needs and challenges. There is no magic formula for creating the optimum staffing model, however these best practices can serve as an effective guide towards achieving quality-driven success metrics. Whatever model works best for your organization, it is important to ensure that you take the time to understand your challenges and build a model based upon your needs.</p>
