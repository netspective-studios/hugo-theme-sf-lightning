<p>Medical coding and clinical documentation requirements have become more complex in recent years. This added complexity can create significant administrative burden for physicians and contribute to operational inefficiencies. Hospitals and health systems are increasingly leveraging technology solutions, such as natural language processing, to help alleviate physician burden and improve clinical documentation accuracy.</p><p>Becker's Hospital Review recently spoke with Jason Mark, manager of Data Science and Natural Language Understanding teams for 3M Health Information Systems, about how natural language understanding (NLU) — the latest evolution in natural language processing (NLP) technology — is streamlining workflows for clinicians, clinical documentation improvement specialists and coders. The current COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique backdrop to illustrate the power of these technologies.</p>
