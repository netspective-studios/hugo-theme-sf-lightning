<p>Supply chain leaders are reconsidering the industry-standard&nbsp;<i>just-in-time</i>&nbsp;inventory model, which dictates that supplies be delivered essentially on a daily basis to sites across a health system.</p><p>The approach is popular because it keeps down costs and does not require a vast infrastructure to accommodate bulk distribution, but it leaves organizations vulnerable to disruptions.</p><p>At the start of the pandemic, VUMC set up its own warehouse and started a self-distribution program for supplies that its analytics suggested could be in jeopardy.</p><p>Going forward, Dail said, “We’re going to keep some of that stock on hand as safety stock for ourselves.”</p><p>Cost concerns have become increasingly urgent in healthcare, never more so than during the pandemic. But those considerations shouldn’t always prevail in supply chain strategy.</p>
