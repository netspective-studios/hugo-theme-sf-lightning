<p>The social determinants of health have become a household term in the healthcare industry’s vernacular, with leaders and organizations aiming to address these influences to provide more comprehensive care.</p><p>Patients’ wellness is primarily impacted by factors outside healthcare facilities, so having access to social determinants data has become a critical part of care delivery.</p><p>Barriers like a lack of data standards and costly datasets can hinder an organization’s ability to access social determinants information, Andrade noted. However, developing an approach for more holistic patient care will be necessary for every entity looking to improve patient and population health – whether the data is complete or not.</p><p>Defining where the biggest challenges lie within an organization or patient population is an essential part of these data plans. Advanced tools like AI and machine learning can help leaders get to the underlying reasons for these challenges.</p>
