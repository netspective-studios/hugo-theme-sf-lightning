<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is known for using big data to detect anomalies in medical imaging, predict health outcomes, personalize treatment plans, even perform robotic surgery. One of the newest entrants to the AI movement is a form of “conversational AI” aimed at helping restore the doctor-patient relationship by alleviating the documentation burden.</p><p>Conversational AI is well suited to helping doctors realize this aspirational outlook. Voice-enabled technology is able to listen to conversations between doctors and patients that occur naturally during an encounter, whether in person or through a telehealth platform. The AI then captures, interprets, and transforms the content required for the medical record, such as a SOAP note. No command language or trigger words are used; doctors just speak normally.</p>
