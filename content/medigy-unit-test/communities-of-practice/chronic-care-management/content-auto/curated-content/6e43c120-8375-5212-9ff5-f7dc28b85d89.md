<p>Value-based care has been a key focus for hospitals over the past decade — at least in theory. But many providers have been slow to abandon traditional fee-for-service models or invest in the technology they need to actually deliver value-based care. COVID-19 has forced healthcare organizations to do a decade’s worth of digital transformation in a matter of months. As they deploy mobile healthcare technology to help them weather the pandemic, medical professionals are also building better infrastructure to deliver value-based care long into the future.</p><p>Of course, COVID-19 will eventually be contained, and social distancing measures will become a thing of the past. But telehealth and smartphone-carrying clinicians are here to stay — not as a replacement for in-person treatment, but as a way to supplement in-person treatment and provide connected value-based care.</p>
