<p>Organizations were forced to augment and accelerate their telemedicine capabilities in 2020 and now have an opportunity to take a step back and consider key questions they didn’t have time to think about earlier this year.</p><p>After setting overarching goals, think about your distinct equipment requirements such as network, connectivity, material needs and even lighting within your clinical ecosystem. For example, a computer used for virtual visits must have an adequate camera, speakers, and microphone, and enough processor speed to run the required software. Seamless technology and equipment integration will drive the most impact towards your telehealth goals.</p><p>Implementation and consistent evaluation are critical to ensure that long term telehealth adoption is successful. Reconvene the original stakeholder group to discuss the implementation, ask who needs to be trained, and train across the organization.</p>
