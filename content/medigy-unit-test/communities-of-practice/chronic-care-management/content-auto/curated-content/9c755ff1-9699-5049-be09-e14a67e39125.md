For example, at-risk populations benefit from the AI-powered monitoring of chronic issues. This area especially holds promise for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, illustrating how machine learning models have the potential to augment the decision-making processes of medical professionals. Additionally, this proactive monitoring approach prevents costly emergency hospital trips.</p><p>To better gauge the current use of AI and machine learning within the healthcare insurance field, our team surveyed technology professionals working in that arena. In this case, 50% of the respondents noted a current involvement with projects using either predictive analytics or machine learning.
