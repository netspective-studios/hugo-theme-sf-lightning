<p>Patients can easily become lost in the healthcare system. A patient moving from the emergency department to an inpatient hospital stay then to a specialist, and finally following up with their primary care provider can be complicated. Follow-up care can be delayed or non-existent. But this only increases a patientâ€™s chances of ending up back in this cycle.</p><p>Some studies have even shown that care coordination can improve cost savings up to up to $296 per member per month, making it impactful to the two key elements of value-based care: improving patient outcomes and decreasing costs of care.</p>
