<p>Telehealth has been critical to the safe management of the coronavirus pandemic, while also delivering uninterrupted care for patients with medical conditions.</p><p>For telehealth services to continue effectively, increased capacity for both clinical staffing and IT infrastructure will need to be addressed. Even hospitals and healthcare systems that do not currently have a large array of telehealth services should assess where to begin as the patient/provider experience evolves.</p><p>To do so, making every aspect of telehealth, from the initial appointment to follow-up care, secure and robust with effective IT infrastructure in place will be key for its continued adoption and expansion.</p>
