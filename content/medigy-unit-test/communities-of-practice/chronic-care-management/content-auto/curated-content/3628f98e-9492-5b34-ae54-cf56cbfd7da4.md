<p>In 2020, we’ve seen the pandemic accelerate the need for greater healthcare interoperability and digital solutions. Notably, providers that have offered telemedicine, virtual visits and other digital services fared better than those that have not. The new ONC and CMS rules, which target U.S. organizations, require healthcare payers and providers to provide patients with open access to their data and a secure data exchange between the different parties. As a result, patients should have improved access to health information.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if CIOs don’t act now to create a plan on how to meet CMS requirements, they face potential fines for failing to comply. The key is effective planning and taking advantage of the time now to implement new processes.&nbsp;</p>
