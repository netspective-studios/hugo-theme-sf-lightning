<p>In March, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) released the interoperability rule as a part of the 21st Century Cures Act, primarily focusing on data exchange and patient information blocking.</p><p>Proposed in February 2019, the rule also supports patients accessing and sharing their electronic health information, which helps patients coordinate their healthcare.</p><p>The rule also prohibits information blocking and aims to hold health IT developers, such as EHR vendors, accountable as a condition of certification.</p><p>The interoperability rule focuses on making patient data more interoperable for patients, providers, payers, and virtually the whole healthcare ecosystem.</p><p>The ONC rule will require information to be more standardized, imposing terminology standards on the informationâ€™s meaning.</p><p>The rule also requires APIs to open up access to that information. It then clarifies to every provider organization that it must share this access, thus relieving HIE organizations' burden.</p>
