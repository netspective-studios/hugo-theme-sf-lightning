<p>Big changes to Medicare coding guidelines for outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) services take effect in 2021, reflecting new federal policies aimed at reducing administrative work for care providers.

Thanks to recent advances in clinical technology, consumer desire to avoid hospitals in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and a number of other factors, demand for outpatient services should continue to grow in 2021 and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>In this context, provider organizations can take a number of steps to ease the coding and documentation burden in the months and years ahead.</p>
