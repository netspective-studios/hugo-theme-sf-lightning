<p>Cybersecurity, so far, remains the most daunting challenge facing the healthcare industry, amplifying every passing day. Data breaches occurring every year cost the healthcare industry as much as $5.6 billion per annum, according to Beckerâ€™s Hospital Review.&nbsp;<br>What is even more alarming is the fact that these cybersecurity risks are becoming increasingly difficult to identify, prevent and mitigate. And while cybercriminals may hack through a given healthcare organization in only a matter of seconds, it more than often takes weeks and even months to detect the breach. Moreover so, with the rapid adoption of EHR and mobile devices, healthcare cybersecurity departments have become highly prone to oversights that unintentionally invite malicious hackers on board.</p>
