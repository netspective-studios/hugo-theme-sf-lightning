<p>In recent years, the healthcare industry has faced several changes - from the updates to the Affordable Care Act to changes in Medicaid and other healthcare programs. All these have presented challenges to hospitals, particularly to their revenue cycles. With new information and regulations, errors are bound to happen, especially when the hospital is ill-prepared for these changes. When the issue is left unaddressed, it presents a serious hindrance to the hospital’s growth and capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Although there are several solutions available to you, it’s essential that you educate yourself on the common challenges to your revenue cycle. By getting a better understanding of their causes, you can identify potential issues and risks before they balloon into major problems.</p>
