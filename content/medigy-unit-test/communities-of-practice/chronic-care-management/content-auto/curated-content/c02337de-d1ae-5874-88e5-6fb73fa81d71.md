<p>The point of care has increasingly been switched from hospitals to homes or to other places the patient requires help. We have seen a quick surge in hospitals and medical centers using telehealth technologies to enable virtual visits and remote care delivery for their patients. Interestingly, the technology existed in the pre-COVID period as well, but organizations were reluctant to capitalize on it because neither providers nor patients truly believed that telehealth would work for effective and quality delivery of care.</p><p>COVID has shown us that telehealth should be an integral part of care delivery as an effective and safe way of treating patients and containing the spread of infections at hospitals, clinics, and medical offices. More importantly, both patients and providers experienced the convenience factor of care being delivered at their proximity.</p>
