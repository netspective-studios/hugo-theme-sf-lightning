<p>Addressing patients' chronic conditions across America remains a top priority for healthcare leaders hoping to improve outcomes and control costs.</p><p>"If you want to reduce your ER visits, if you want to improve health, if you want to reduce hospitalizations and help people, you've got to help people change behavior," Manejwala said. "Because at the end of the day, if you change 50, 100, or 200 things a person does, it can have a very dramatic impact on outcomes."</p><p>The solution to engaging patients with chronic conditions in a time of social distancing and the increasing digitization of everyday life is finding the right technology to make the process convenient.</p><p>For healthcare organizations looking to expand in an area such as telehealth, the key consideration should be to identify tools that can take some of the pressure off providers to drive desired outcomes.</p>
