<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to push patients away from in-person care, many health systems have ramped up their remote patient monitoring ecosystems.</p><p>But with that increase in endpoints comes an increase in security risks.</p><p>"From a security perspective, we always model a personal home network as a hostile network," said Stephanie Domas, executive vice president of the MedSec cybersecurity service. "I have to build it that way because I have no control over that network."</p><p>Teaching an organization's staff members not to click on suspicious links doesn't help, she said, when a medical device is connecting to an individual's network outside the system.</p><p>What seems to work well, she said, is having a separate workflow for medical devices, with medical-device cybersecurity having its own governance structure within a hospital.&nbsp;</p>
