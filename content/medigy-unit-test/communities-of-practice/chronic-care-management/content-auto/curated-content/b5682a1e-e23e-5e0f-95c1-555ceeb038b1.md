<p>The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused one of the most financially crippling situations for healthcare in decades. Besides the clinical implications, hospitals and health systems that typically operated on razor-thin margins prior to the outbreak were now faced with unprecedented challenges to their bottom lines.</p><p>Yet, in a time of crisis, some leaders have looked at the economic downturn spurred by the pandemic and are seeing opportunities to harness emerging trends and salvage lost revenues, thereby maintaining financial solvency. Feirn, Klasko, and other healthcare industry experts discuss four financial opportunities for health systems to alleviate the financial and operational impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
