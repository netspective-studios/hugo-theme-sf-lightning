<p>The risks of cyberattacks on hospitals and other healthcare settings were already high pre-pandemic, as these institutions work with sensitive data, like patient information. But attackers never let an opportunity go to waste, and they’ve already targeted the manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines—including a known attack on Pfizer.</p><p>“Third parties are really a top risk.
