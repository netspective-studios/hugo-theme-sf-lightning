<p>Patient portal adoption and registration have been a critical goal for healthcare organizations ever since the Medicare &amp; Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs launched the technology into the limelight.</p><p>And although those programs no longer exist—at least in their previous form—and there aren’t as many federal dollars hanging on having at least one unique patient view, download, or transmit her own medical data, the push for high adoption rates still persists.</p><p>Healthcare organizations still use the patient portal to accomplish a number of tasks, like securely message their patients, get appointments on the books, and coordinate across an entire suite of tertiary patient engagement tools.</p><p>More recently, healthcare organizations have noticed the power the patient portal has to host telehealth and other remote care access options, something that saw something of a boom during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most experts anticipate that the boom will last long after the pandemic subsides.</p>
