<p>Just as revenue cycle executives are coming up for air from the&nbsp;CMS price transparency mandate, they have another date to add to their compliance calendar: January 1, 2022. That's the day that the&nbsp;No Surprises Act&nbsp;goes into effect.</p><p>The&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;has two main parts. First, it protects patients from surprise medical bills.</p><p>From a consumer perspective, the No Surprises Act essentially makes out-of-network balance billing a thing of the past. That's especially important for patients who live in states that don't already have such protections in place.</p><p>According to the commonwealth fund, 18 states have no balance billing protections in place. The rest have comprehensive or partial protections.</p><p>Although the legislation won't go into effect for nearly a year, there are things that revenue cycle executives should be thinking about and working on as they prepare.</p>
