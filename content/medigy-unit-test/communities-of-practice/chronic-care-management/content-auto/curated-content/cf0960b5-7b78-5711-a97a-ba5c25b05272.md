Nearly all patients using an electronic patient-reported outcomes tool said it was easy to use and collected relevant information about their health. Patients and their clinician counterparts agree: real-time electronic patient-reported outcomes systems are useful for improving the patient experience, according to a study out of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center.

The study, which leveraged a real-time electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) and symptom tool, demonstrated these technologies could help cancer patients and their providers get better information about cancer patient care trajectory. Especially for patients, this boosted their experience of care. This study built on a previous one looking at whether an ePRO technology could improve clinical outcomes.
