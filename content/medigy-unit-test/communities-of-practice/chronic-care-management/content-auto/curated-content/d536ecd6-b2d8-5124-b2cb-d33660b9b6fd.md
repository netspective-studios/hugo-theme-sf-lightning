We have entered a brave new world in telehealth - and a much bigger world, with the growing acceptance of using smartphones, laptops, and other digital devices to access and share medical information.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, more physicians integrated these new health technologies into their clinical practice. A recent American Medical Association (AMA) digital health study reports that over the last few years, physicians surveyed had doubled their usage of the tool, citing digital health as a key driver to improve quality outcomes, cost efficiency, and patient access.

Telehealth has particularly expanded among primary care physicians and physicians under the age of 50. AMA Board Chair Jesse M. Ehrenfeld, MD, MPH, said, &quot;The rise of the digital-native physician will have a profound impact on healthcare and patient outcomes and will place digital health technologies under pressure to perform according to higher expectations.&quot;
