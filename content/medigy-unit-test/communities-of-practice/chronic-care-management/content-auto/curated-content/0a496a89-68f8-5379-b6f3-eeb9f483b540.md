<p>The idea of having a crystal ball to better understand what claims will be denied is an awesome concept. But one we can’t rely on. Thankfully, we have predictive analytics to take the place of a crystal ball. Predictive analytics can produce results quickly, effectively and accurately. Many health systems use predictive analytics to identify and mitigate claims denials before they occur.</p><p>The amount of revenue leakage is just too great to not have people focused on these efforts. While determination to stem revenue leakage is commendable and necessary, predictive analytics can help providers process more claims more quickly and effectively. The outcome is fewer denied claims, which leads to improved revenue.</p>
