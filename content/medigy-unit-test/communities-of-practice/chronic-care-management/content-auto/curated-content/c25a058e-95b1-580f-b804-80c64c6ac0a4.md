A new platform for collecting and surfacing patient health data is bound to impact the clinician and patient experiences. It’s important to consider how the RPM program will fit into your practice’s unique workflows — otherwise, you risk low adoption from staff and patients alike.
 
Without clearly assigned roles and responsibilities, it’s easy to see how a program could run into trouble. As you map out each of the steps above, consider which members of your staff will own which responsibilities, and what that will mean for their overall workload. 

Staff members also need to understand how and why what they’re doing is helping the patient. In that case, they are much more likely to enroll patients if they believe in the program themselves and see how it could improve the patient’s quality of life.
