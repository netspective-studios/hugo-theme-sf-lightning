<p>Mission statements from healthcare organizations come in many shapes and sizes, but at the heart of all those missions is the intention to provide high-quality, patient-centered care that improves the health of those served by the provider. While that intention is straightforward enough, the act of delivering on that promise is not. Regardless of size, healthcare organizations must balance myriad processes, many of which are not direct patient care. A prime example is revenue cycle management.</p><p>Revenue cycle outsourcing isnâ€™t just an option for struggling providers. In fact, outsourcing may not be enough for a truly distressed organization to turn the corner, Shields said. For these organizations, outsourcing can help to identify and implement improvements for better revenue capture and collection.</p>
