<p>Saying that telehealth has moved front and center amid the COVID-19 pandemic is an understatement. With the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) now reimbursing for remote care models, adoption of telehealth is rapidly advancing as physicians strive to overcome barriers to continuity of care and maintain operations amid stay-at-home orders.&nbsp;</p><p>For many practices, telehealth is unchartered territory that poses some notable risks for reimbursement. Providers must&nbsp;have processes in place that ensure complete, accurate capture of documentation necessary to support codingand billing activities. Doing so will not only ensure billing compliance, but also provide a boost to the bottom line at a time when it is desperately needed.&nbsp;</p>
