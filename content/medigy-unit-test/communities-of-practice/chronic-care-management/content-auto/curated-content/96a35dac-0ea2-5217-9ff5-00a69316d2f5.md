<p>As the number of COVID-19 cases begin to decline, healthcare leaders are finally able to take a step back and assess the gaps that the pandemic has exposed in their operations. When they do, workforce management, should be on their list of key areas to address, according to Nanne Finis, Chief Nurse Executive at Kronos.</p><p>Physicians, nurses, admin support staff and even maintenance teams want to be able to use mobile tools at work that are similar to what they use in their personal lives. They want to easily communicate with colleagues, they want to be able to see their work schedules integrated with their calendars and they want to be able to self manage their work schedules.</p>
