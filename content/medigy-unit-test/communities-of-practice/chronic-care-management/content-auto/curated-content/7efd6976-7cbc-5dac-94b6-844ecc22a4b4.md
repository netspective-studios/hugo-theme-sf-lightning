<p>An alternative model that's gaining bipartisan support is value-based care, which aligns incentives with successful outcomes to boost populations' health and simultaneously lower overall costs – not by reducing services but by being proactive and reducing costly catastrophic events. Physicians operate on a set healthcare cost per patient in an advanced value-based care system (global capitated risk).</p><p>Physicians and patients have been shifting in favor of value-based care in recent years. The demand for better transparency, as well as the trend toward consumerization, lower technology costs, and the dramatic increase in telehealth driven by the pandemic, are some of the stars that are beginning to align.</p><p>Finally, for technology and healthcare leaders, the opportunity to help engineer a value-based care system is the chance to make a life-changing impact for every American for generations to come. &nbsp;</p>
