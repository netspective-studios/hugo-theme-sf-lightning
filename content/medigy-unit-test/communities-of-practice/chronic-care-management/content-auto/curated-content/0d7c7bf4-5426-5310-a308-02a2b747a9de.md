<p>Successfully monitoring patient data privacy must focus on two key entities: the employees accessing records&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;the patients whose records are being accessed. Organizations need to be able to visualize and correlate events across these entities and throughout the IT infrastructure and EMR applications to detect suspicious patterns while adhering to reporting and compliance mandates.</p><p>Monitoring EMR applications is crucial to detect and prevent suspicious activity that may lead to data compromise. However, this can be a cumbersome process. Given that nearly all EMR records contain patient data information, organizations must maintain this data's confidentiality while enabling security monitoring. Unfortunately, most traditional SIEMs do not provide solutions to this problem. As a result, organizations are forced to intermix sensitive patient data with other IT data, risking compliance violations.</p>
