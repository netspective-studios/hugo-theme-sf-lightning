<p>In addition to the physical toll it takes on individuals, burnout also takes a financial toll on our healthcare system. It Is estimated that physician burnout costs the U.S. healthcare industry $4.6 billion per year or roughly $7,600 per physician per year.</p><p>One of the most commonly cited reasons for physician burnout is work overload. In addition to increased patient caseload, physicians also have to juggle quality and cost performance measures, unplanned distractions, and a never-ending list of administrative procedures. The stress of getting everything done during the day while also providing quality care at the lowest cost possible is enough to make physicians most resilient want to hang up their stethoscope.</p><p>Regardless of the technologies a physician chooses to use to help manage the balance in the workplace, it is critical that they take steps to care for themselves.</p>
