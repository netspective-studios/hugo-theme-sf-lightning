<p>The pandemic has shown the best of American healthcare (collaboration and selflessness on the part of providers, to name some highlights) but also many of the system’s challenges. From a practical perspective, the primary challenge was compensation, explained the chief physician executive and COO at Southwestern Health Resources and former senior physician advisor at CMS’ Innovation Center.</p><p>But the push to pay out value-based payments begs a broader question about provider compensation, Doddamani stressed.</p><p>Furthermore, data from the Primary Care Collaborative and the Larry A. Green Center showed that nearly a fifth of primary care practices had temporarily closed in May despite ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 in their communities.</p><p>Meanwhile, practices that were able to stay open had to quickly pivot operations to ensure their patient's and providers' safety. Chief among those changes was telehealth.</p>
