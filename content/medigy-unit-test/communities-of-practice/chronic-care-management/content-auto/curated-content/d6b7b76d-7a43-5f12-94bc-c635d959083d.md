<p>As organizations continue in their shift to cloud-based and mobile-first business operating environments — a transition that has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic — the traditional, perimeter-based security approach is becoming less viable option protection.</p><p>An effective defense against attacks today requires a zero-trust approach to security that questions each and every device accessing the organization’s network, along with every action that takes place.</p><p>While deploying zero trust certainly requires high-level networking skills and deep expertise in security technologies, this shouldn’t discourage security teams from implementing a zero-trust approach. Organizations might be surprised to find they already have the tools they need to get started.</p><p>Technology such as device visibility solutions and network segmentation can go a long way in helping an organization develop a zero-trust architectural model that can adapt rapidly to evolving cybersecurity threats.&nbsp;</p>
