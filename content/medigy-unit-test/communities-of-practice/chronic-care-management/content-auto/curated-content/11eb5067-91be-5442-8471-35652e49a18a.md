<p>With modern technology, not even the most welcoming office can humanize health care the way a virtual house call can. For years, we’ve assumed that physicians and patients must sit together in the same exam room to develop personal, trust-filled relationships. But COVID-19 has proven that communication technology can create enormously personal connections.</p><p>It’s easy to see why patients are eagerly embracing virtual relationships with their physicians as well. Eighty-three percent of Americans say they expect to make telehealth visits after COVID-19 has ended. This number is huge when you consider the fact that just eight percent of patients had ever had a telehealth visit before the pandemic hit. Many organizations put telehealth in place so quickly that they are struggling to live up to patient expectations when it comes to virtual communication.&nbsp;</p>
