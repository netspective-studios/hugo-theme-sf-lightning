<p>According to&nbsp;a news release, the Geographic Direct Contracting Model will see participants taking responsibility for the patients’ health outcomes, which will give them a direct incentive to improve care. In each region, organizations with experience with risk-sharing arrangements and population health will be partnering with physicians and community organizations to better coordinate care.</p><p>Patients in the model will maintain all of their original Medicare benefits, such as being able to see any provider they choose. They can also receive enhanced benefits like additional telehealth services, access to home care, access to skilled nursing without an extended stay in the hospital, and concurrent hospice and curative care, the release says.</p><p>Participants will also be able to reduce patient cost-sharing for Part A and Part B services and also offer patients a Part B premium subsidy.&nbsp;</p>
