<p>The COVID-19 pandemic brought on an era in which nearly every activity of our lives went digital. And while many yearn for a return to pre-pandemic days in the healthcare business, the “new normal” is here to stay with even more progression from digital health (the gathering of information) to data-driven healthcare (actionable decisions based on the data).</p><p>Healthcare organizations need to invest further in AI and other related advanced technologies. Clinical workflows will become more agile by virtue of AI and advanced analytics that automate decision-making processes. The emergence of these technologies requires a transformation from digital health to data-driven healthcare, given the fundamental role of data in automated decision making.</p><p>The key is to communicate effectively with a seriousness of purpose why these advances matter and how their use will directly maintain and improve patient care.</p>
