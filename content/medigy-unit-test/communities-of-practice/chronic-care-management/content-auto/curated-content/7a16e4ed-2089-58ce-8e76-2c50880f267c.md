<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the home healthcare industry to a crossroads.</p><p>More older adults are comfortable with mobile devices and smart technologies that help them&nbsp;safely age in place. Some individuals may be seeking to avoid full-time care in a congregate care setting due to the public health emergency.

Organizations must come up with creative and effective ways to serve this population — whether or not they can physically be there.</p>
