<p>The process of tracking, storing, and distributing millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine is a monumental undertaking, requiring an array of IT tools to coordinate and maintain fluid supply chains.</p><p>As healthcare providers grapple with the rapid and unprecedented mass development, distribution, and administration of COVID-19 vaccines, they are turning to technologies such as RFID tags and 2D barcodes, which can encode vaccine identification information to help reduce errors and make vaccines traceable.</p><p>One factor that could support the rollout, according to Sara Jost, global healthcare industry lead at BlackBerry, is a mass notification engine that could send and receive notifications as the vaccines travel along the supply and distribution chains.</p><p>“This would allow each group — from pharmaceutical distribution, government, healthcare administration, healthcare workers and patients — to have easy and accurate communication,” she says.</p>
