<p>While new rules for interoperability should have an impact, providers can get ahead of the game now by implementing EHR-integrated solutions that not only help the flow of patient data between providers but also improve access to care and ultimately help clinics generate revenue. Patient engagement technology has been around for some time, and its ability to automatically update EHR systems based on patient interactions has been a game-changer.</p><p>EHR systems are an enigma of the healthcare industry. They deliver tremendous value, but they can be excruciatingly frustrating and time-consuming. True EHR system interoperability is years away from reality, but there are measures that providers can take now to maximize the value of their EHR system to improve the patient experience, increase access to care, and improve the bottom line.</p>
