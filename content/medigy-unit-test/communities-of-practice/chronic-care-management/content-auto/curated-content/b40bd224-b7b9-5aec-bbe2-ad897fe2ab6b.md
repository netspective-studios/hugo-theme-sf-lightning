<p>Cyberattacks against the healthcare sector have been making headlines lately, ranging from attacks on coronavirus drug makers to telehealth and IoT devices. One of the largest medical cyberattacks in U.S. history occurred in September when&nbsp;Universal Health Services&nbsp;was hit with what appears to be a ransomware attack, affecting the company’s 400+ locations for several days.</p><p>Healthcare organizations continue to have the highest average costs associated with data breaches. As this sector becomes a bigger target for bad actors, it’s important to evaluate some of the biggest vulnerabilities and how these can be combatted with an active defense approach.</p>
