Enhanced EHR usability leads to higher EHR adoption rates, fewer clinical errors, lower clinician burnout, increased financial flexibility, and improved patient safety. However, EHR users from across the country report significantly different user experiences with the technology.

Quality EHR training is essential to provider users, especially those new to the technology. An effective EHR training program can improve EHR usability, which also reduces the likelihood of clinician burden and boosts satisfaction.

Integrating EHR informatics into a training course will allow users to understand EHR design and it will provide context to the intricacies of the technology.

Each generation or class of EHR users are more used to utilizing technology in their day-to-day lives. In fact, some clinicians might even demand a level of functionality and interaction that an EHR, because of its complexity, does not yet deliver.
