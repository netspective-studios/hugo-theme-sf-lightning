Without leveraging HIEs, the coronavirus recovery timeline could extend.</p><p>HIE networks can streamline patient data sharing between providers.

The platform can evaluate this by having a longitudinal view of patient medical records to see a patientâ€™s vaccination status.</p><p>The two authors said public health officials could leverage HIE data to assemble a list of age-eligible individuals and high-risk individuals.
