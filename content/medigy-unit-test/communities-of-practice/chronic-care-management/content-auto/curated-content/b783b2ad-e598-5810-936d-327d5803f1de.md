<p>The demand for telehealth services has grown significantly in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Patients expect the technology to work well. Patients also trust healthcare providers to protect their data. Data privacy should be top of mind and not an afterthought. After all, data privacy protects the patient by protecting his or her data.</p><p>Without appropriate safeguards for patient data, patient safety can be at risk. Safeguards must be in place to keep patient data both private and secure. Data privacy and information security work hand in hand. One cannot exist without the other.</p><p>Good privacy and security necessarily require the appropriate technical controls to be in place (such as encryption and authentication) and also adherence to best practices. Both are equally important. Ultimately, patient data and other sensitive information should be vigilantly protected: protect the data, protect the patient.</p>
