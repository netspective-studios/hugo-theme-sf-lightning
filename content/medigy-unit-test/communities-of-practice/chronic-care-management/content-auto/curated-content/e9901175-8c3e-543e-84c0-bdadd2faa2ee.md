<p>The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) defines telehealth as the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support and promote long-distance clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, and public health and health administration. Technologies include videoconferencing, the internet, store-and-forward imaging, streaming media, and landline and wireless communications.</p><p>Healthcare providers have promoted telehealth use as a safer way to deliver acute, chronic, primary, and specialty care. They’re reporting an astonishing 50-175x increase in the number of telehealth visits from pre-COVID days.</p><p>While healthcare providers await policy changes, they’re challenged to scale existing or adopt new telehealth programs to meet patient demand.</p>
