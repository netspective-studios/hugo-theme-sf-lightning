<p>Practices are interacting with patients in the digital realm more than ever before. During the COVID-19 pandemic, providers began to leverage new telehealth capabilities and intensified mobile apps and web portals. These virtual channels provide immediate care while protecting patients and frontline staff from transmission risks associated with unwarranted in-person contact.</p><p>To guide those arriving on their digital doorstep, many practices are incorporating virtual assistants, chatbots, and even “digital humans,” which combine artificial intelligence (A.I.) with a lifelike face and verbal inflection to express empathy and convey emotional context in their dialogue.</p><p>A chatbot, virtual assistant, or digital human can learn and respond to the frequently asked questions and educate inquirers about illnesses, risks, and other related factors, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Additionally, their multilingual capabilities allow digital humans to be understood by anyone, no matter their background or geographic location.</p>
