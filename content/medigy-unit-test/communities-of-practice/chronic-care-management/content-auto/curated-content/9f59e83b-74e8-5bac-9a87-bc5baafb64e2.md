By leveraging mobile communications&#39; power and reach, mHealth makes it possible to provide a more versatile and personalized approach to health care. However, for mHealth to reach its full potential, four critical dimensions must align people, places, payment, and purpose.

**People: Demographics**

A nuanced understanding of demographics such as age, gender, and income can point to technology preferences and help drive customization and targeting of users&#39; mHealth experiences.

**Places: Local Infrastructure**

The convergence of infrastructure needs (reliable local networks â€“ cellular, broadband and wireless, download speeds, and bandwidth capacity) and rapid technological development may be a tipping point for mHealth adoption.

**Payment: Reimbursement and Regulatory**

Value-based reforms prompt health care organizations to:

*   Find more efficient ways to improve care while increasing quality.
*   Expand care delivery outside the hospital and physician office.
*   Facilitate patient-provider connectivity &quot;anytime and anywhere.
