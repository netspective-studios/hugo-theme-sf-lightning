<p>AI, the next-generation electronic-health-records (EHR) system, or any number of other shiny objects brought to my attention in this way&nbsp;<i>might</i>&nbsp;be very important. They&nbsp;might<i>&nbsp;</i>advance the organization’s strategies beautifully. They&nbsp;might<i>&nbsp;</i>enable strategies that we hadn’t even thought of before. They&nbsp;might&nbsp;be the key to our survival.</p><p>Or they might not. They might waste money and time, divert us from our goals, and allow more disciplined competitors to eat our lunch with wiser technology choices and better implementation. The next-generation EHR — so compelling in demo mode — might lock up at random times once it’s crunching real data. The AI that caught the board member’s eye might make recommendations that enrage the medical staff — or worse, mystify them.</p>
