Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is more than just fancy activity trackers. It is a way to reduce hospital admissions, lower healthcare costs, and provide better care and outcomes for patients. With RPM, physicians can leverage data to help give patients better feedback regarding their conditions and treatment. Besides, RPM can also be a way to increase revenue for outpatient practices.

Capturing the charges for the RPM services is equally important. Since the monitoring codes are only billed once a month, you must have a way to track which patients have met the 20 minutes each month. The initial set-up and device codes can be billed on the day the patient is in the office and set up on the device.
