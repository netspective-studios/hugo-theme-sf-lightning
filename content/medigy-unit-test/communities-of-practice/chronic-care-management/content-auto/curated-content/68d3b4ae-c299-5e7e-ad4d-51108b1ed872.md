<p>As regulations and requirements increase and the pressure and urgency to optimize financial performance (especially in light of the revenue lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the C-suite recognizes RCM can no longer succeed without focused strategic attention and intention.</p><p>Provider organizations have two options. One is to build a staff exclusively focused on RCM. That means hiring people, training them, paying salary and benefits, finding space for them, giving them the proper equipment and technology, etc., at a time when many hospitals and health systems are already struggling to remain financially viable.</p><p>The second option is to acquire these capabilities by working with a managed services partner that already has proven expertise, processes, trained personnel, technology, and best practices, etc., in RCM.</p>
