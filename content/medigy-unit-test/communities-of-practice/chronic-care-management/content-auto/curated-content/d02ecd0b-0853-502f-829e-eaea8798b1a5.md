<p>Providers often spend more time documenting than seeing their patients, resulting in poor care experiences and stunted patient-provider relationships.</p><p>At Providence, one of the country's largest health systems, leaders were searching for a solution to problems stemming from EHR documentation.</p><p>The AI platform can not only listen to pertinent information from patients but also transcribe it into the appropriate medical language – medicine, dosage, symptom descriptions – and adds that data to the EHR.</p><p>To ensure the success of the AI tool, Moore and his team are evaluating the system in different parts of care delivery. Providence clinicians will also be able to offer feedback on the solution, Moore noted.</p>
