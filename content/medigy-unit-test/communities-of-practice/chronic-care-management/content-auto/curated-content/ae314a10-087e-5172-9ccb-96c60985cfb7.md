<p>Patients need to connect with their care providers to build trust and communication. But the COVID-19 pandemic has placed barriers in the way of that connection. Due to the pandemic, clinicians must socially distance themselves from patients as much as possible, while patients are largely confined to their rooms.</p><p>Fortunately, numerous technologies are helping not only to ensure continuity of care but also to make the conversations seem as close to the real thing as possible. They’re helping patients, and care providers connect.</p><p>Even medical tools are going virtual with the growing adoption of digital stethoscopes. The bottom line is that, regardless of whether they’re used for in-patient or home telehealth visits, these collaborative technologies are no longer a “nice to have” feature; they’re essential.</p>
