<p>Implementing ethical remote workforce monitoring measures is a balancing act that must take into account questions of privacy, legality, consent, and fairness. On the other side of the equation, monitoring of this sort may be important not only for business reasons but to maintain ethical working conditions such as fairness throughout all segments of the workforce.</p><p>Employers that employ remote workers often need to implement some form of remote workforce monitoring, principally for some combination of “maintaining data security levels, and assessing employee productivity.” However, some forms of remote monitoring can invade the privacy of workers. These may include the installation of keylogging software on the remote worker’s computer, or installing remote access software on the computer and instituting random check-ins.</p><p><br><a href="https://www.remotedesk.com/blog/article/the-ethical-complexity-of-remote-workforce-monitoring">Read on remotedesk.com</a></p>
