<p>Telehealth has recently taken off as a way to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, but even though telehealth has been around for several years, clinics had difficulty adopting it pre-COVID-19. This caused clinics not to view telehealth as a viable option, and it was often seen as a last resort approach to healthcare.</p><p>When telehealth and other clinical functions are interoperable within the clinicâ€™s existing EHR, practitioners will have more time to spend with patients and less time on administrative tasks.</p><p>Additionally, telehealth helps reduce patient no-show rates, and increases care access to those with limited access to transportation and patients who live in rural communities.</p><p>Another benefit of having telehealth seamlessly integrated into the EHR platform is that video technology is HIPAA-compliant through 256-bit AES encryption of all meeting data and chat messages.</p>
