<p>Of course, the meaning of total cost of care (TCoC) is best thought of as the cost to payers rather than a practice’s actual internal cost to offer services, Cohen noted. “[TCoC] is truly from the eyes of the payers, not from the eyes of a provider — it’s their cost associated with their patients or with their beneficiaries,” Cohen said.</p><p>In that view, TCoC includes the entire care continuum, not just the care provided at one practice. “It really encompasses not only the care received from that physician, but the follow-up care received by the patient that’s been seen, either for specialty care or ancillary services, surgical care, hospital stays, post-acute care — you name it,” Cohen added.</p>
