<p>In the healthcare industry today, it is widely understood that optimal health outcomes require addressing patients’ clinical and non-clinical needs – their social determinants of health.</p><p>So much of individuals’ health is determined by factors beyond the doctor’s office. Where someone lives, works, and plays directly impacts her well-being, and it’s critical for health systems to gather and understand their patients’ social determinants data.</p><p>However, for many healthcare organizations, it can be challenging to know where to start with addressing patients’ social determinants. A lack of industry standards makes it difficult to collect and share this essential information, and healthcare entities may not be equipped to address unmet social needs.</p><p>UVA implemented a real-time artificial intelligence platform that integrated directly with hospital EHRs.
