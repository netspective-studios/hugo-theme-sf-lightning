<p>Despite the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine doses since mid-December 2020, there have been numerous logistical issues and ethical questions about how best to distribute those doses.</p><p>While rural patients are just as likely to know someone who tested positive for or died from coronavirus as urban and suburban patients, KFF data shows about four in 10 rural Americans (39%) are not worried they or someone in their family will get sick from coronavirus. More so than urban and suburban patients,&nbsp;rural Americans believe the seriousness of the coronavirus is exaggerated, and they also view getting vaccinated as mostly a personal choice at a higher rate than urban and suburban Americans.</p><p>To ensure efficiency, Kleylaâ€™s team worked to digitize as much pre-visit work as possible, including self-scheduling, consent forms, review of fact sheets, and information about possible contraindications.</p>
