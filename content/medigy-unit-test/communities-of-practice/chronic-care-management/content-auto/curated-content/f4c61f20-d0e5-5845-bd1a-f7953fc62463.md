<p>Now, when physicians want to meet with a COVID patient virtually, they can launch the visit via their own tablets or smartphones and connect directly to the in-room television monitor. Or, if an onsite nurse determines a virtual consult is needed, he or she may notify a doctor through the telehealth portal and use the remote control from outside a patient’s room to cue up the TV.</p><p>The setup has reduced staff exposure to COVID-19, preserved personal protective equipment, and saved time and expenses associated with carting cleaning equipment from room to room.</p><p>Others in the medical arena agree. “These systems are going to be beneficial to both nursing and support staff in responding to a patient’s needs,” says James Welch, president and chief strategy officer with ARC Biomedical Consultants in Bend, Ore.&nbsp;</p>
