<p>Before the sudden surge in telehealth visits, only 9% of U.S. respondents said they had received healthcare virtually, and only 11% said their doctor recommended digital tools to manage their health.</p><p>That said, the level of trust depended on who was providing the service. The vast majority of people said they trusted hospitals and doctors to keep their healthcare information safe — 84% and 83%, respectively — while just 45% of users said they trusted tech companies to do the same.</p><p>A higher number of consumers also said they’d be willing to receive virtual care from traditional healthcare providers than other groups. 54% said they would consider this, while 27% of respondents said they would from technology or social media companies, 25% said they would from retail brands, and 21% said they would from medical startups.</p>
