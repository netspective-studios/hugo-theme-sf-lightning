<p>Everyone is producing data that can inform a value-based care strategy, from health plans and providers to state-level agencies and other facilities across the care continuum. Yet, sharing that data has not always been easy for all those involved in patient care.</p><p>Lack of interoperable health IT systems and data standards, technology inadequacies, and worse, information blocking and other unsavory practices that restrict the exchange of healthcare data have all contributed to data sharing issues in healthcare. And, in turn, value-based care deficiencies.</p><p>With more meaningful data from health plans and other sources, practices can also start to make more informed decisions about operations and even primary care compensation. But overall, the data enables groups like Summit CityMD to deliver value to all patients by gaining a clearer picture of their populations.</p>
