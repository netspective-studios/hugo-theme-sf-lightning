<p>Physician practices are feeling the pain immensely, too. As with many small businesses, the pandemic has had devastating financial consequences on provider practices. Stay-at-home orders have resulted in postponed non-emergency surgeries, plummeting office visits, and staffing shortages due to illness, lack childcare, furloughs, and layoffs.</p><p>Providers who hope to survive and stay profitable need to know the financial impact the crisis is having on business today as well as long-term implications. After planning for declining revenues and understanding fixed costs, the next challenge is setting a timeline for getting back in action as states start to reopen businesses. This requires real-time analytics â€” not retrospective reports and pivot tables in Excel.</p><p>Financial forecasting leverages data found in practice management software. It helps providers predict future financial impacts based on their current and past trends, delivering up-to-the-moment, daily insight into the following key areas of business.&nbsp;</p>
