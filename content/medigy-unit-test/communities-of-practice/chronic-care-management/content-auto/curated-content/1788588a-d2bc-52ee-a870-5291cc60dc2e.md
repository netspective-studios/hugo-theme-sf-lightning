<p>Patients recognize the role that they must play in their own care management while at home, the report suggested. Patients know that if they are not visiting their medical providers, they need to be engaged in their own care in order to stay healthy.</p><p>Clinicians should capitalize on this moment, especially considering clinicians are among the most trusted sources of health and COVID-19 information among patients.</p><p>The survey results show that patients are trying to put wellness into their own hands, so they donâ€™t have to access healthcare as often. Patients are looking to engage in healthcare self-management, largely enabled by patient engagement technology.</p><p>Notably, this could speed up the rate of value-based care models, which generally operate on the basis that providers will drive wellness care with patients in order to cut down on more expensive interventions down the line.</p>
