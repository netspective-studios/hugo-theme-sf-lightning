There is no correct approach to chronic disease management. Evidence throughout the world suggests that, to be successful, policy-makers should consider:

− providing strong leadership and vision at the national, regional or organizational level;

− ensuring robust collection of information and data-sharing among all stakeholders;

− providing care based on people’s needs and an ability to identify people with different levels of need;

− targeting key risk factors, including widespread disease prevention initiatives;

− supporting self-management and empowering people with chronic diseases; and

− involving a wide range of stakeholders such as individuals, the voluntary and community sector, clinicians, private industry and public services.
