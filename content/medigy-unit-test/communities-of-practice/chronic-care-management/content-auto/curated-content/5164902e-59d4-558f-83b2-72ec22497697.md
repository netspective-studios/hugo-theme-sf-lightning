<p>Telemedicine has allowed providers to extend care to more people while helping keep down costs and increasing patient convenience. The telehealth market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 30 percent between 2020-2025, and that’s likely a conservative estimate based on its surge since March 2020.</p><p>At the same time, healthcare organizations, including hospitals and medical centers, are still recovering from the revenue hit they took due to COVID-19.</p><p>Healthcare needs to think larger when it comes to the patient’s behalf and create an exhaustive virtual care environment to strengthen engagement. Patients not only anticipate a variety of modern remote monitoring, care, and communication options from providers, but they’re also demanding it.</p>
