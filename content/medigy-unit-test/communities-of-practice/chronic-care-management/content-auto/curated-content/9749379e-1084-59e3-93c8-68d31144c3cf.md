<p>Arcadia sends over 1 million text messages in a frictionless outreach to close gaps in care, says CMO Dr. Rich Parker.</p><p>"Well, there is a great deal of vaccine hesitancy in the country in general about all vaccines. So I’m concerned about the general skepticism in the population about all vaccines. Still, I’m very hopeful that with the need and urgency for the covid vaccine to get us out of this dilemma, people will be willing to take it." says CMO Dr. Rich Parker.</p>
