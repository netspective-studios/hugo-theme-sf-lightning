<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic creating some necessary constraints on how, when, and where people access health care, digital health resources have emerged as a valuable bridge that can help keep health care providers and their patients connected.</p><p>As health care providers look for ways to expand patient services and grow their practices, leveraging digital health technologies is likely to become increasingly important.</p><p>It’s also important to keep in mind that investing in virtual care capabilities may support your practice’s progression through the continuum of value-based care and encourage success in risk-based contracts with health plans.
