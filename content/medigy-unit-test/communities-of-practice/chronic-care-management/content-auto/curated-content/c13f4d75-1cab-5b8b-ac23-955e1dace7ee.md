<p>Lifestyle choices and chronic conditions are now the biggest threats to public health and sustainable health care costs. CCP prepares the interdisciplinary health care team—and wellness, disease management and chronic care specialists—for the new environment. Chronic care improvement also lies at the heart of new models such as the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) and the accountable care organization (ACO). Their success will be determined by their effectiveness at&nbsp;routinely delivering recommended medical care—and applying evidence-based steps for patient engagement, lifestyle management, treatment adherence and decision and self-care support.&nbsp;</p><p>CCP includes the definitive manual for health coaching across the care continuum—with medical care guidelines and shared decision-making tools for 30 chronic conditions.</p>
