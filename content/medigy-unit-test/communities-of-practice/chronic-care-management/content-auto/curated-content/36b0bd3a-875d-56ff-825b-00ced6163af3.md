<p>As seen in the most recent ransomware wave, EHR&nbsp;downtime&nbsp;amid a national health crisis can put patient safety at risk. At least a dozen healthcare providers were driven to pen and paper due to ransomware, with some diverting ambulances because of computer outages.</p><p>Those attacks have already continued into this year, with&nbsp;one provider&nbsp;reporting outages due to ransomware during the first week of January.</p><p>In recent months and already this year, massive phishing campaigns and social engineering attacks are finding great success in manipulating employees into engaging with malicious emails.</p><p>Hackers are increasingly improving the appearance of these emails by masquerading as legitimate sources and brands, as such, strengthening employee security education and training around common and current threats should be a key focus for all healthcare entities.</p>
