<p>As healthcare providers shift into high gear to administer the vaccine, IT tools and systems are playing an important role. By carefully and comprehensively tracking where the vaccine is, how it is being handled, where it is being administered, and how it is working, healthcare organizations can level a powerful new tool in the fight against a virus that has had a massive impact around the world.</p><p>The federal Operation Warp Speed initiative aims to produce and deliver 300 million doses of the approved vaccines. As with nearly every other aspect of the pandemic, the vaccine rollout requires organizations to operate far more quickly than they may be accustomed to. Details regarding every aspect of the program are still being determined, which creates confusion and uncertainty.</p>
