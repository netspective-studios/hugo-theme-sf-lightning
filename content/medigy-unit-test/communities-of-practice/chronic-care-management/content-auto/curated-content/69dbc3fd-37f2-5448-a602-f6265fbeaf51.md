<p>The long-awaited debut of 2021 has come and gone. And while many physician practices are ready for a fresh start, the reality is that the unprecedented financial challenges of 2020 will have a lingering impact.</p><p>One mid-year 2020 study from the American Medical Association found that providers' average drop in revenue amid the pandemic was 32%.
