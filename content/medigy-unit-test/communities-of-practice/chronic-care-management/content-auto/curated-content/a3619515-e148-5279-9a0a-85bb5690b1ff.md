<p>Views on vaccines will vary among political leanings, age groups, geography, race and ethnicity, and even essential worker status, and not all the concerns are the same. Historically underserved populations may be leery of the safety of a vaccine and worried about possible side effects, whereas rural patients may be hesitant simply because they believe the coronavirus's seriousness is exaggerated.</p><p>If your practice is administering vaccines, provide a waitlist for eager patients ready to get their shot. If a patient does not want to join a waitlist for the vaccine when it becomes available, consider asking to put them on a list for outreach so that a team member can call them or otherwise share education on the benefits and safety of the vaccine.</p>
