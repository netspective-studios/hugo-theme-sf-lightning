The acceptance and utilization of telehealth services within the US were already on a sharp incline before the COVID-19 crisis erupted globally. Since then, medical and municipal leaders are leveraging the platform as a tool in combating the spread of COVID-19, accelerating adoption in the process. 

Consumers are showing increased interest as well, with SEMRush reporting a 146.15% increase in searches for “in-home doctor visits” and a 53.97% increase in “in-home medical care” searches. Gartner analysis of SensorTower data shows that Telehealth Apps also see a considerable spike – Doctor-on-Demand, Telehealth by SimplePractice, Amwell, and Plushcare show a 630% increase in iOS downloads for the week of March 16th, compared to the weekly average for the previous ten weeks.
