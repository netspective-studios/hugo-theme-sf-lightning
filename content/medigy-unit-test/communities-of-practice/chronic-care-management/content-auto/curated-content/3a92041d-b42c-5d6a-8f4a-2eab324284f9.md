<p>COVID-19 has caused a massive acceleration in the use of telehealth. Consumer adoption has skyrocketed, from 11 percent of US consumers using telehealth in 2019 to 46 percent of consumers now using telehealth to replace cancelled healthcare visits. Providers have rapidly scaled offerings and are seeing 50 to 175 times the number of patients via telehealth than they did before.&nbsp;With the acceleration of consumer and provider adoption of telehealth and extension of telehealth beyond virtual urgent care,&nbsp;<strong>up to $250 billion of current US healthcare spend could potentially be virtualized.</strong></p><p>This shift is not inevitable. It will require new ways of working for a broad set of providers, step-change improvements in information exchange, and broadening access and integration of technology.</p>
