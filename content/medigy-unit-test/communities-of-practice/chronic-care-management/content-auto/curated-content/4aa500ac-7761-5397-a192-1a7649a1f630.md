<p>The COVID-19 crisis is forever reshaping traditional care delivery models. Many changes—such as the integration of virtual care and shifts away from hospital-based sites—have been in the works for many years. Others may be very new, in response to dramatic changes in economic conditions, consumer demands, and market dynamics.</p><p>Care delivery redesign strategies for the post-COVID era should be developed with multiple goals in mind, including developing a leaner business model that maximizes resources, is responsive to new consumer expectations, and that facilitates the highest levels of care. Such strategies will help organizations right-size their care delivery chassis, facilitate efficiencies, and reduce costs in preparation for an all-new healthcare environment.</p>
