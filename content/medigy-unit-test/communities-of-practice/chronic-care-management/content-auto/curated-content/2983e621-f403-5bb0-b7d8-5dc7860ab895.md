<p>In order to achieve good financial experience, healthcare organizations need to invest in data and price transparency, as well as digital tools that streamline the patient access and intake process, the experts added.</p><p>Patient satisfaction is a long sought after element of the healthcare encounter, with medical organizations measuring satisfaction and implementing solutions to get scores higher.</p><p>Those efforts have a key financial imperative: healthcare organizations get paid, in part, for having positive patient satisfaction scores. And where those scores donâ€™t inform reimbursement levels, they do influence organization reputation. One bad Yelp review could hamper provider bottom lines.</p><p>And while most would agree on a good bedside manner, clean and inviting hospital environment, and positive clinical outcomes are the hallmarks of patient satisfaction, the financial experience is also at play.</p>
