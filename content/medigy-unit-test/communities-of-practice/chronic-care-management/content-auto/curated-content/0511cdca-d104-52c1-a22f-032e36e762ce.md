<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&nbsp;has been a hot topic among healthcare professionals for quite some time. Any tool that they use to schedule, communicate, and manage the virtual visit will collect or transmit Patient Health Information (PHI) at least once. Without the necessary precautions taken, all of those cases are considered a&nbsp;HIPAA violation&nbsp;which has quite hefty penalties.&nbsp;</p><p>The best way you can avoid such situations is to make sure that all the tools you use are HIPAA compliant.&nbsp; Also, as the healthcare provider, you have to enter a Business Association Agreement with them. These seem daunting, however, not being able to function due to HIPAA violations is far worse.&nbsp;</p>
