<p>As organizations continue to adapt and adjust to today’s shifting realities, it’s important to extend existing interoperability setups to help ensure systems are prepared for the tsunami of information it will need to exchange. Currently, the lack of unifying capability in the form of a single patient ID makes it challenging to match an individual’s records across payers, providers, and facilities. Additionally, there’s no single standard for data quality across the industry or across the multitude of systems, such as electronic health records.</p><p>In spite of these challenges, moving forward to strengthen your organizations’ approach to interoperability is a step in the right direction—one that can help your organization quickly adapt and prepare you for a successful future.</p>
