<p>The greater our understanding and familiarity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes in healthcare, the greater the magnitude of its impact on the patient and provider experience as a whole.

We’re only just beginning to learn how to harness the power of AI in ways that cultivate stronger healthcare systems — and ensure that the value of connection akin to the human condition is not lost but rather nurtured in its use among healthcare providers.</p>
