<p>Personalized email marketing is an effective, cost-efficient strategy to improve patient outcomes, boost your brand, and grow your healthcare business.</p><p>There are various ways to encourage patients or potential patients to opt-in to receive marketing emails from you. For example, you can include a marketing authorization form in a new patientâ€™s intake paperwork or provide a signup link on your website.</p><p>Successful email marketing engages readers with content that benefits them. Patients will be more likely to open and read a message that solves their problem or is genuinely useful or interesting.</p><p>Spelling errors and poor grammar reflect poorly on your practice and make it hard for patients to seriously take the message.</p><p>At least one other set of eyes needs to review them because it can be difficult for you to spot mistakes since you are so close to the content.</p>
