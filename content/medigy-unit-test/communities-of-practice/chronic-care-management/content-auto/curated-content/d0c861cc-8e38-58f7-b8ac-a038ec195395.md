<p>There’s a reason the healthcare industry is shifting toward value-based reimbursement models and away from volume-based care. Value-based care reimburses healthcare providers based on the quality of care they provide, rather than providing payment for each test or procedure. Value-based care incentivizes the quality of patient care over quantity; outcome-based reimbursement is the goal, benefiting both the patient and the provider.</p><p>The traditional model of volume-based reimbursement, otherwise known as fee-for-service care, is based on the number of services performed by a healthcare provider. Providers are paid based on the number of patients they have and the number of tests and procedures they order. The more tests ordered, the higher the payment.</p><p>Value-based care emphasizes high-quality, lower cost, and preventive patient care. Rather than be reimbursed for each test ordered, providers have incentives to collaborate and reduce redundant care.</p>
