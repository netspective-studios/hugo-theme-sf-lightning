<p>Clinicians at Providence, one of the country’s most extensive health systems, are feeling the clinical impact of COVID-19, and clinician burnout is becoming widespread across its 51 hospitals and 1,085 physician clinics.</p><p>Once COVID-19 hit, more and more patients were coming to the system’s clinics and hospitals, forcing clinicians to spend more time in front of the EHR.</p><p>EHR documentation, when clinicians record clinical information as provider notes in real-time during an encounter, help providers share patient information among health providers. However, the practice has its drawbacks.</p><p>While EHR adoption has its benefits, Moore said it could negatively impact the clinician to the patient encounter, and it ultimately adds more time to the clinician workday. This solution aims to enable clinicians to focus on the patient and spend less time on administrative tasks that contribute to frustration and clinician burnout.</p>
