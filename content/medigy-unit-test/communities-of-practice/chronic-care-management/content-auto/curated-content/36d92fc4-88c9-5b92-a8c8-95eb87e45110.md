<p>For private practices, especially smaller or newer practices, patient acquisition is the key component to growing a successful business. However, too often, healthcare practitioners don’t think beyond the value of an immediate new booking to consider the true potential of patient retention.</p><p>For the practice, a satisfied patient is almost always a loyal patient, and that means a greater likelihood they will book regular visits for necessary care and follow-up.</p><p>It’s a well-known fact that retaining a customer is usually easier and cheaper than acquiring one. As your practice moves forward in continually expanding your patient base, integrating retention tactics into the mix will work toward your overall practice growth and patient satisfaction.</p>
