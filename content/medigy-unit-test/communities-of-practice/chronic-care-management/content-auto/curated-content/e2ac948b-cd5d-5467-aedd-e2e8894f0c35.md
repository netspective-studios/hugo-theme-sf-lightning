<p>The pre-billing process during which the hospital, EMS agency, or physicians group financially clears the patient shouldn’t require one or more full-time billing specialists submitting and re-submitting claims, chasing down billable coverage for 60-90 days. Yet in the U.S. healthcare system, so many people representing so many interests touch patient data that there are multiple points at which essential data can be corrupted or deleted.</p><p>It’s not just the time and effort saved that makes the technology so valuable. Billing the claim to the right party the first time translates into many benefits. The entire revenue cycle is more efficient, fewer claims are rejected, and there’s even a cost saving on postage with less returned mail. Importantly, accurate billing also contributes to higher patient satisfaction and protects the provider’s reputation.</p>
