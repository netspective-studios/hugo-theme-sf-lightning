<p>This March, as the coronavirus pandemic began its trek across the United States, for the first time in its history, HIMSS&nbsp;<strong>closed down its annual conference</strong>, the largest healthcare IT convention in the nation. It issued the notice three days before the official start of the gathering, more than 40,000 people were expected to attend, and President Donald Trump was set to take the stage.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of delivering the HIMSS keynote on March 9, Trump declared a national public health emergency, while The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services simultaneously released their&nbsp;<strong>final interoperability rulings</strong>.</p>
