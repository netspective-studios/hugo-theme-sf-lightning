The medical industry is increasingly focusing on creating a better patient experience and driving patient satisfaction scores. Patients are in charge of finding their care, disclosing important medical data prior to appointments, and reaching out to providers for help in between visits.

Health tech developers have begun to identify those pain points and are introducing new products to market that could help alleviate them. As providers work to ease the healthcare experience for patients, these tools may be of help.
