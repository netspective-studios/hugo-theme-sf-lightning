<p>Providers traditionally follow a three-pronged approach for closing care gaps: quality scorecards, population health management, and patient engagement. While quality metrics and population health initiatives generally satisfy the first two pillars, providers tend to struggle with effective patient engagement. With the changes to the structure and delivery of primary care, providers need to double down on patient engagement strategies. To close care gaps, providers must know everything there is to know about a consumer. Clinical data alone are not enough to bring a patient in for an age-related screening.</p><p>To close care gaps, providers must have a holistic view of the healthcare consumer. A single view of the healthcare consumer is the key to providing a relevant, personalized healthcare experience that drives improved outcomes through improved engagement and satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>
