<p>We know that successful care management programs require significant investments in personnel, IT support, and collateral resources to support cross-continuum care coordination and ongoing quality improvement initiatives. ROI, however, isn't the only consideration in play. Care management also generates value on investment (VOI) â€“ tangible outlying or downstream results that are not immediately attributable to care management or care managers' specific actions. These are equally important in evaluating the impact of a care management program.</p><p>Given the rampant variation across health systems, there are likely to be a range of challenges when it comes to populating data for these domains. To that end, organizations should deploy a structured approach to fill in the data for these domains<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and ultimately set the stage to calculate an ROI.</p>
