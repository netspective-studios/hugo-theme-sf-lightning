<p>2021 will be another year of major innovation for healthcare technology. Because COVID-19 has disrupted the way medical practices operate, we will see how developments in security, infrastructure, data, and patient networks play a pivotal role in how practices are run this year. &nbsp;</p><p>This means that with this new API standard, patientsâ€™ medical records can more quickly and seamlessly travel between medical institutions, decreasing the reliance on paper records. &nbsp;</p><p>For example, suppose a patient with aggressive cancer is getting care from one team at a medical facility and decides to take that information to get a second opinion from another care team. In that case, they can quickly take that information coming through FHIR data and present that to the next medical team.&nbsp;</p>
