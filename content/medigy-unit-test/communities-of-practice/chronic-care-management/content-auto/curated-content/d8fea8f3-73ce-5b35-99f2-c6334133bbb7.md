<p>As physicians reopen and strive to keep open their practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to patients, caregivers, staff and themselves are just as, if not more, necessary as ever. It will be those measures, clearly communicated, consistently implemented and updated as new evidence becomes available, that will engender in patients the confidence they need to seek care</p><p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) also has published and updated its guide for reopening facilities to provide non-emergent, non-COVID-19 care. Building upon this guidance, the American Medical Association suggests using the following checklist to ensure that your medical practice is ready for reopening and is well-situated to remain open going forward.</p>
