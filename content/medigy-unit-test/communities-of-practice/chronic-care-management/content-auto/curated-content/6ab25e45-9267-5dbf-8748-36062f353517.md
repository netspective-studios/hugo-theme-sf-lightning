<p>One of the most pressing priorities for healthcare organizations was expediting their adoption of cloud technologies to more efficiently manage the deluge of patient information, ensure streamlined workplace practices, and enable information sharing with greater ease. As local leaders made decisions about how to keep their populations safe, cloud infrastructure provided the ability to collect, analyze, and share data securely across and among a global network of organizations.</p><p>Through this period of rapid cloud adoption, there has also been a swift uptick in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies. From enabling information sharing and analysis without sacrificing data privacy to ensuring patients with the most urgent needs are given the quickest response, these technologies have revolutionized the COVID-19 healthcare response and will remain critical well beyond the pandemic.</p>
