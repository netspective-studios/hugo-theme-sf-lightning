<p>Healthcare has been moving toward a hybrid care model—a mix of in-person care and care at a distance—since the U.S. was hit with COVID-19 in early 2020. The need for this model will likely continue in some form through the pandemic and beyond. Success with hybrid care requires a series of workflow changes and technology adoptions that easily support both types of visits. Below is a list of some of the important changes healthcare organizations should consider.</p><p>Automated reminders are more important than ever to ensure patients know what type of appointment they have scheduled—in-person versus telehealth. The reminder should also provide instructions and links for telehealth.</p><p>Supporting a combination of virtual and in-person visits requires tools that support an almost entirely digital workflow. Intake forms should be sent via text or email to be completed ahead of time electronically.</p>
