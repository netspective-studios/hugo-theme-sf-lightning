<p>Remote patient monitoring and teleparamedicine are some of the most important&nbsp;current healthcare industry trends. As the interaction between doctors and their clients involves protected health information (PHI), increased cybersecurity is necessary for such communication.</p><p>More than&nbsp;75 percent of U.S. hospitals&nbsp;use teletherapy as of now. Besides making the lives of many people a lot easier, telemedicine might cause healthcare data breaches. To avoid that, any tool used to share PHI must comply with the HIPAA guidelines.</p><p>Remote medical treatment is an excellent modern way to treat patients. To ensure e-health leads only to desired outcomes and does not result in privacy violations, HIPAA compliant telemedicine must be used.</p>
