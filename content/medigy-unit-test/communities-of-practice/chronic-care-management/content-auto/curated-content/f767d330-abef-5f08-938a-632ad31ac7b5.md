<p>As the medical industry continues to embrace the patient as a healthcare consumer, providers, and technology developers alike have sought to create a personalized healthcare experience. AI has proven to fill that gap, helping to make sense of patient data and needs and generate action items that can ideally activate the patient.</p><p>And patients are primed for this new type of technology, and research has shown. In 2018, Accentureâ€™s Consumer Survey on Digital Health showed that patients are welcoming of AI technology in healthcare. And again, in 2019, patients expressed a strong interest in AI for helping to manage their own health and drive convenient care.</p><p>Healthcare organizations are beginning to respond to that need, implementing tools that leverage AI, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to aid in not just clinical operations but inpatient engagement efforts, as well.</p>
