Determining the right approach for member engagement around care management requires deep understanding not only of the factors that put members’ health at risk, but also the cultural barriers that may inhibit success in establishing a care management relationship.

Eighty percent of members’ health is determined by social factors such as housing, economic position, education and social connections, so called social determinants of health. But, most healthcare organizations struggle to use social determinants data to target members for focused intervention, a recent study found.

Even when payers and providers have access to a range of data that can point to the need for targeted social support interventions, they face challenges in effectively engaging members and providers in these support services that improve health and health outcomes.
