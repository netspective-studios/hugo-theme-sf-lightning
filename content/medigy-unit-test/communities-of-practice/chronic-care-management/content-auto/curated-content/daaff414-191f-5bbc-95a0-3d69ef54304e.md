<p>Between artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and personalized text message appointment reminders, it has become routine for health systems to leverage mobile-based technology in one way or another. At one health system, the surgical center is using text messages to inform surgeons of their appointments for the day, all while sending reminders to patients.</p><p>In this episode of Data Book, we speak with Lora Swenson, business manager at KU MedWest. Swenson will discuss how KUMedWest is leveraging PerfectServe's technology to improve the patient experience and make workflows more efficient. Swenson talks about the technology, how she implemented it into the surgery center at the hospital, how it benefits patients and physicians alike and what other C-suites and healthcare executives need to do to boast such a platform.</p>
