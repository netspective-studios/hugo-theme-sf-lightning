<p>Effective Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) is non-negotiable for all health care practices, but despite this, clinics across the board are reporting increasing levels of dissatisfaction with their current RCM tools.</p><p>RCM includes everything surrounding claims processing, and the revenue cycle is the most important administrative function for health care practices. Without it, clinics and hospitals can’t financially support themselves in order to treat their patients. Effective RCM isn’t something clinics should take lightly—their revenue cycles need to be optimized at every stage to ensure cash flow.</p><p>According to data from Accenture Analytics, using advanced, user-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) solutions can save clinics $7 billion each year. RCM tasks such as coding, billing, collections, denials, and more can now be easily automated with AI.</p>
