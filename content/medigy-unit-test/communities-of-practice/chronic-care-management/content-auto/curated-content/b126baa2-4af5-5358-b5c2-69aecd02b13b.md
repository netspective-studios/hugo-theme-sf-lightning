Some healthcare systems easily pivoted to telehealth solutions, but for many, the transition was anything but smooth.

In this StartUp Health Expert Office Hour session, Terri Seppala, CEO, and Founder of consulting firm Telehealth Associates, shares her cross-market insights on the needs and pain points of providers, hospital systems, and health centers as they navigate the landscape of digital health solutions.

The need to pivot to telehealth represented a massive change to healthcare systems — just like the change moving from paper to EMR. EMRs represented this large change where it affected everything in a practice: workflow, processes, and HR. Telehealth is the same thing.
