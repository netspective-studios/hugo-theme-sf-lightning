<p>Advances in natural language processing, or NLP, a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to understand spoken or typed remarks, are prompting healthcare organizations to leverage that field.</p><p>In areas such as voice-activated assistants and speech recognition platforms, NLP is creating better experiences by expanding patient access to information, cutting transcription costs and delays, and improving the quality of health records. Providers also report the tools can lower stress and allow more face time during appointments.</p><p>Measurable gains are important when assessing speech-driven tools, but providers say some of the most important value is personal.</p><p>“If we are spending our time typing, it’s less time to see patients, less time to be thinking about a case and working out problems,” Ingham says. “Collectively, that all is a factor when it comes to burnout.”</p>
