No matter what your specialties are, most healthcare groups have had two common experiences during COVID-19:

*   The first is a newfound reliance both on local listings and on fast, informative physician engagement.
*   The second is a pressing need to rebuild revenue streams – which means rebuilding patient trust.

In this webinar, Shahid Shah, Co-Founder of [Citus Health](https://www.citushealth.com/) and Publisher of Netspective Media&#39;s digital health properties, joins David Elstein, Senior Communications Specialist for the [American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery](https://www.abos.org/). In a conversation with [Binary Fountain](https://binaryfountain.com/) EVP of Strategy &amp; Corporate Development Andrew Rainey, they’ll cover key strategies for engaging providers, determining which financial losses are recoverable, and recouping lost revenue through reputation improvements and digital tools.
