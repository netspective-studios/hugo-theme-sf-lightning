<p>Release of information (ROI) isn’t just about the technology. It’s about the people (i.e., the implementation team) behind the technology that can ultimately improve the overall ROI experience for staff, patients, payers, and others. The implementation team can facilitate any transition and help organizations meet their ROI goals—whatever those goals may be.</p><p>If an organization’s current release of information (ROI) process isn’t working—or the process is riddled with compliance risk due to lack of a streamlined approach across multiple disclosure points—there’s no time like the present to change course. This is true regardless of whether the organization wants to transition its in-house ROI to a vendor or change from one outsource vendor to another. Start where you are, and change the ending.</p>
