<p>As providers rushed to implement telehealth when the pandemic hit this spring, even hospitals with operations well underway were forced to accelerate their plans massively. The results — patients preferred virtual care in many cases, and technical barriers were overcome relatively quickly — mean many systems are pursuing a future of hybrid care that incorporates telehealth as a core piece.</p><p>While telehealth access is still a concern, and some patients will always prefer in-person care, most providers have reported that patients rate their telehealth experiences highly.</p><p>The health system also found a swell of new patients that surprised them, indicating an opportunity for increasing visit volumes and outreach. It sent a single email to all clinic patients and hospital patients going back three years, informing them of an online screening tool that could direct people to virtual visits if needed.</p>
