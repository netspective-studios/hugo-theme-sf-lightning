<p>For organizations suddenly burdened with staff shortages and other constraints caused by the COVID-19 crisis, the benefits of automation were no longer purely about making cost efficiencies but about building resilience. &nbsp;</p><p>Tasks like billing, processing claims, managing patient records, and other repetitive, time-consuming tasks are well suited to software bots, as they can help free-up time for healthcare staff to spend with patients.</p><p>RPA has also been deployed to solve specific problems that have arisen as a result of the pandemic. COVID-19 testing requires a substantial amount of repetitive admin, including finding and registering patients in the system, correctly labeling test kits for collection and analysis, and logging test results, in some cases, into a national database containing millions of other entries. Additionally, there is a huge demand for tests that have created backlogs in many countries, while social distancing rules remain in place for staff.</p>
