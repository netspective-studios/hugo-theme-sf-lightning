The COVID-19 outbreak is causing complex repercussions as it spreads at unprecedented speed, overwhelming healthcare systems globally and affecting all other industries.

Healthcare systems, now more than ever, need to quickly adapt their businesses and decisions to meet the needs of their patients. The ability to leverage rapidly changing data to drive the best decisions will be critical to cope during these uncertain times.
