<p>While many health systems are looking into the future to determine how to continue the acceleration of virtual care, experts say it is also essential to hit the pause button. To ensure long-term success, organizations should assess whether they deliver the best experience, determine how telehealth fits into the overall care delivery model, and examine the role trust plays in their endeavors.</p><p>"Think about how you blend virtual and physical environments as part of how care is delivered," says Kalis. "There's the opportunity to make virtual health not a standalone solution, but something that is integrated into traditional modes of care."</p><p>"Now, out of necessity," says Kalis, "clinicians were recommending digital health solutions to keep people safe in their homes and also maintain their health." For virtual care to continue thriving beyond the crisis, providers need to continue to play an active role in recommending it, he says.</p>
