<p>Healthcare has and will likely always be a prime target for cyberattacks, given its valuable data and the need for constant data access to ensure continuity of care. While awareness around these issues has drastically improved, the need for a zero trust in healthcare will be crucial moving forward given the sector’s staffing gaps, limited resources, and other challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the disparities,&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;imperative that the sector address these challenges now. Ideally,&nbsp;zero&nbsp;trust infrastructure could remediate issues with credential theft,&nbsp;authentication, authorization, and even a heavy reliance on Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).&nbsp;</p><p>But with limited staffing and resources,&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;important to ask: just how feasible would a zero trust&nbsp;model&nbsp;be in the healthcare sector?&nbsp;</p>
