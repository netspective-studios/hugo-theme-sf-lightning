<p>While many elements influence the country’s rising healthcare spending, the prevalence of the chronic disease is perhaps the most significant factor at play.</p><p>Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in the US and the main drivers of the country’s $3.5 trillion in annual health costs.</p><p>Conditions like diabetes, cancer, and kidney disease take a massive toll on healthcare spending and patient outcomes, making chronic disease management and prevention top priorities for providers across the nation.</p><p>In a global health crisis, these efforts have become even more consequential. Evidence has shown that underlying chronic diseases can lead to poorer outcomes in people infected with COVID-19, putting further strain on the healthcare system.</p><p>However, managing and preventing chronic conditions in patient populations is a time-consuming, challenging task. The development and treatment of chronic diseases typically involve multiple features that differ from patient to patient.</p>
