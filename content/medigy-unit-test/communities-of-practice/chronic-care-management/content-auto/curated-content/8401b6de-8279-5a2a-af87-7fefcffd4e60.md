Already in 2018, the popularity of remote patient monitoring (RPM) solutions was high, and the RPM market was forecasted to grow to $31 billion by 2023. But in view of COVID-19, I see that this process accelerates even more as many healthcare providers opt for remote patient monitoring in addition to in-hospital smart patient tracking systems to deliver technology-driven care outside of clinical settings as well.

 At the moment, it is difficult to overestimate the importance of RPM technology for telehealth services and, I believe, the efforts and investments for implementing an RPM solution are completely worth it. Let’s investigate what can make an RPM solution a great option for you to achieve a higher quality of healthcare services.
