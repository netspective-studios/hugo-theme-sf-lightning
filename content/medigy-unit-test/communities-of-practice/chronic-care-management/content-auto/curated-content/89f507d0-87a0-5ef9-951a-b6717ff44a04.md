<p>As anyone who reads this site would know, it’s become steadily more important for providers to capture and use patient-directed data.</p><p>Increasingly, hospitals and clinics live or die on how patients respond to and engage with their care. This extends far beyond whether patients had a nice warm fuzzy feeling after their medical visit, out into the real world where their complaints are perhaps even more important than the positive grades they award to providers. I’ve come to believe that this complaint data – particularly complaints made and tackled while patients are still undergoing care – could be the next leap forward in understanding patient experiences.</p>
