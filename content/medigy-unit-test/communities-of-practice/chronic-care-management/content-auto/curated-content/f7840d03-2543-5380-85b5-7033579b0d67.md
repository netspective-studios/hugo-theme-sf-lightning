<p>On January 1, CMS' controversial price transparency mandate for hospitals went into effect, but the passing of that date is only the beginning of how organizations will have to deal with the rule.</p><p>Right up until the end of December, hospitals tried unsuccessfully to get the rule delayed or invalidated. But just a few days before January 1, a judge threw out the American Hospital Association's appeal of an&nbsp;earlier court decision&nbsp;which upheld the mandate, and pleas to delay the rule because of the COVID-19 pandemic have gone unheeded.</p><p>Although the mandate has gone into effect, there are still unanswered questions, namely around determining which physicians CMS considers "employed" and, therefore, subject to inclusion in the mandate.</p>
