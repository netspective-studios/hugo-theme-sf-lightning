<p>The issue of price transparency as a readily available tool to physicians as part of their EHR platform has become more widespread as technology has changed. But getting frontline physicians to use those tools – and to have those crucial conversations with their patients – is still a work in progress.</p><p>Medication price transparency is really making sure both the physician and the patient are fully aware of their costs associated with that medication. It's so important now because medication costs have obviously been increasing. Secondly, benefit plans have become more complex. And third, people care deeply about these costs. We surveyed about 1,000 individuals, and 28% of millennials said they would be willing to find a new doctor based on whether or not that physician was able to have a medication cost conversation with them.</p>
