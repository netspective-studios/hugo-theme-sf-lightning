<p>Increased adoption of cloud computing is a central tenet of the ongoing digital transformation in healthcare, offering organizations of all sizes the potential for cost savings, greater efficiency, and logistical advantages in remote work and virtual care delivery.</p><p>Although the continued investment in cloud services suggests that organizations are capturing widespread benefits, optimizing these requires thoughtful planning and an understanding of how to use elastic cloud environments to drive efficiency. When making a case for cloud migration, it’s important to think digital-first, adapting standard practices to the cloud environment. Often, that means becoming a smaller, more agile operation.</p><p>Moving to the cloud also will bring benefits to Geisinger’s virtual care delivery services, including videoconferencing capabilities, says Kravitz. In addition, it will facilitate easier access to data for remote office workers, although he stresses that data security must remain a paramount concern.</p>
