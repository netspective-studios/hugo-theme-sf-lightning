<p>"Protecting our staff and pushing things to work from home was a big focus and continues to be a refining focus in 2021. Banner continues to grow and acquire, so that keeps us busy. The patient financial experience, particularly with the new price transparency regulations that went live in January â€” that's another area. We're not sure how that challenge is going to play out, but it's something we're continuing to stay in front of" says Brad Tinnermon.</p><p>"Modernization started before the pandemic and kicked off in 2018. We were looking for a few things to accomplish, and one was balancing the use of labor and technology. We underinvested in technology and overinvested in labor, which led to a fragile environment volatile from a staffing perspective, so we needed to address that. &nbsp;We also wanted to improve the patient's financial experience." Says Brad Tinnermon.</p>
