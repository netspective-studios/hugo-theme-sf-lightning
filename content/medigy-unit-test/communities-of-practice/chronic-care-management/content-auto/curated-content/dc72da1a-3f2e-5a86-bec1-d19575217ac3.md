<p>Nearly everyone is going to benefit from the shots, meaning providers and healthcare leaders need to figure out the most equitable way to get a limited number of doses out to people. However, there’s still some gray area regarding exactly who will get their vaccine when and how to actually get an appointment.</p><p>That’s not to mention the added foil of a two-dose vaccine, which will require significant patient outreach and management legwork on the part of providers.</p><p>And through all of that, the healthcare industry is acutely aware of the patient experience factor at play. Like the rest of medical care, patients want their vaccines now, and they want it to be an easy process.</p><p>The organization is leaning heavily on its technology suite to make all of that happen.</p>
