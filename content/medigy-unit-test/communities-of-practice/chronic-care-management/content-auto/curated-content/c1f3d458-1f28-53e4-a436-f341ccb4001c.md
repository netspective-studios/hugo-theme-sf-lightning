<p>With the ongoing advances in digital capability and automated intelligence, now is the time to consider a more holistic approach to integrating digital systems and solutions.</p><p>From a tightening labor market requiring higher wages, widespread consumerism, more patients with serious conditions, and a growing, aging population, healthcare labor demand is only going to continue rising in the years to come. In turn, hospitals, acute care facilities, and long-term care facilities must respond by leveraging advanced workforce management systems to optimize their labor-management strategies and provide support for their caregivers, patients, and bottom lines. &nbsp;</p><p>From collecting feedback through employee surveys and offering flexible scheduling options to enhanced training to better understanding their roles, responsibilities, patient volumes, and populations, the labor-management system will provide the means for fostering an engaged and productive workforce.</p>
