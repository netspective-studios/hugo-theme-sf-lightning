<p>In this episode of the MGMA Insights podcast, we’re joined by Matt Seefeld, executive vice president of MedEvolve. He firmly believes in focusing first on the people, then on the processes before aligning both with technology that fosters automated and efficient workflow.</p><p>"Everyone thinks, ‘Well, with A.I., I guess I just won’t need people anymore.’ That’s not true in healthcare and anyone that believes that needs to rethink their position. You always are going to have people, and you’re always going to have processes – some automated, some manual – that have to align with technology. And that is really the key there: aligning with technology. I can hand you the best technology with proven results. But if you don’t align your people, your org structure, and your process with that technology, you will never get to your best.”</p>
