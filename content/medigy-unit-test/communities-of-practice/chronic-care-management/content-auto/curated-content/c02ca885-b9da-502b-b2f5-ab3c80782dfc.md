<p>Early in the pandemic, some healthcare leaders held out hope that cybercriminals would stand down so hospitals and other organizations could focus on treating the sick and studying the virus. They didnâ€™t. Instead, hackers have shifted and refined their tactics to catch busy clinicians off guard and to conduct phishing schemes that play on the public health crisis.</p><p>The number of cybercrimes reported daily to the FBI is&nbsp;three to four times higher&nbsp;than before the pandemic, one official noted this spring. Some of that is due to threat actors seeking COVID-19 treatment insights and attempting to exploit remote work perimeters. To protect your providers and patients, you should know the common threats and vulnerabilities.</p>
