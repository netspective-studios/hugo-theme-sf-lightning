<p>To recoup the lost revenue, practices now face the challenge of re-engaging with patients and convincing them to schedule appointments and come back to the office.</p><p>During these uncertain times, it’s important to think strategically; many physician practices should consider working with partners who can help them identify solutions to ensure business continuity while also addressing safety concerns and consumer needs.</p><p>Instead of trying to connect disjointed solutions across a patient’s care continuum, an EHR-agnostic revenue cycle platform has the technology, automation, and performance analytics needed to create standardized workflows that ensure full data transparency and seamless exchange of information. This ensures timely reimbursement, lower denial rates, and increased cash flow while reducing operating costs since much of the traditional back and forth manual work is eliminated.</p>
