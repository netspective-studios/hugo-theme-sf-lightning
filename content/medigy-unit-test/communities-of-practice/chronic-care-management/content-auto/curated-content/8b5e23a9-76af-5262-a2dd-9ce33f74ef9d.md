<p>Billers and coders play critical roles in patient care, making sure that claims are correct and properly submitted so the practice, ambulatory care center, rehab center, hospital, or other providers can be properly reimbursed. To do their jobs properly, billers and coders need the right software tools to check claims before they are submitted to payers to maximize reimbursement, reduce the incidence of refiled claims, and protect both themselves and their employers from fraud charges.</p><p>Despite technological advances, the claims denial rate remains stubbornly high in healthcare, averaging between 5%-10%. That might not sound like much, but consider a 10% denial rate multiplied by the number of patients seen by practice each day. The result is thousands in potential claim losses per week.</p>
