Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), a rapidly growing healthcare segment, can be the key to driving down readmission rates as well as making medicine more cost-effective and accessible for the masses. A key component of RPM is wearable devices that allow medical professionals to monitor and diagnose patients without ever seeing them in the office. These devices have the ability to remotely monitor patient vitals as well as other symptoms, which can then be used as indicators of impending medical issues.
