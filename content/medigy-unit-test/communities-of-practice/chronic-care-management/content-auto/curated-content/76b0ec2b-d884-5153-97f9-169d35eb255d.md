<p>CCM codes can be billed for services furnished to patients with two or more chronic conditions who are at significant risk of death, acute exacerbation or decompensation, or functional decline. Two thirds of Medicare beneficiaries have two or more chronic conditions, which means many of your patients can benefit from CCM services, including the help provided between visits.</p><p>CCM can help you deliver coordinated care to your patients that will improve their health, increase satisfaction with their care, and make care more person-centered. This toolkit includes information for health care professionals, professional and patient organizations, and community groups, including tips for getting started, fact sheets on the requirements for providing CCM in practices, and educational materials to share with patients.&nbsp;</p>
