<p>But for all the optimistic phrases floating around healthcare, there is one cloudy expression looming over the horizon: health disparities.</p><p>The reality that minority populations or lower-income individuals tend to experience a higher burden of disease, disability, and mortality is something that the pandemic has demonstrated in the harshest of lights.</p><p>While recent vaccine authorizations have offered a glimmer of hope, they’ve also brought validated concerns about distribution and access – many of which have already come to fruition.</p><p>Beyond the pandemic, many conditions disproportionately affect underserved populations, and certain groups consistently suffer worse disease outcomes. Suppose the industry is truly going to drive down health disparities. In that case, organizations will need to develop enduring population health management strategies to enhance clinical care during and after the current crisis.</p>
