<p>The Medicare Direct Contracting program creates new opportunities for organizations to realize Medicare savings and enhance the quality of care through risk-sharing arrangements and primary care redesign. Therefore, it is important for physician groups to understand how their current patient population and payer mix align to the appropriate Medicare Direct Contracting Entity options and level of risk-sharing.</p><p>Provider groups have the option to choose the type of Direct Contracting Entity (DCE) they wish to join based on their experience managing Medicare FFS populations, their existing Medicare FFS patient population, and the level of risk they are willing to assume.</p><p>The voluntary alignment of Medicare FFS beneficiaries to participating providers is a key feature under Direct Contracting and empowers patients to seek care with providers with whom they want to build a relationship.</p>
