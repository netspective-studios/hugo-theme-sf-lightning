Devising viable long-term patient engagement solutions comes down to unit economics. A health system could order 1,000 remote patient monitoring devices, but it won’t realize enough value from each device to make the investment acceptable. In general, the time to value (or the time horizon to ROI) for investments in remote patient monitoring must be shorter so providers are more incentivized to make them — and health systems should be making these investments to live up to their status as providers.

The future of remote patient monitoring might not mean expensive devices in every patient’s home, but providers must be searching for other solutions that extend their clinical relationship and impact into the digital world to drive revenue and preserve patient relationships by supporting improved outcomes.

  

**Insights &amp; Actionable Advice**
