<p>The proliferation of mobile health (mHealth) apps can be both a blessing and a burden to health industry leaders.</p><p>These apps can complement and improve a health system's digital health strategy and patients' experience. For instance, mHealth can be integrated into a variety of service lines and care contexts, with apps targeted for wellness, symptom relief, treatment management, and other purposes. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/the-rise-of-mhealth-10-trends.html"><i>Becker's Health</i></a><i>&nbsp;IT</i>, mHealth also allows patients to better engage in their care and reduces over-utilization of care facilities, ultimately producing cost savings for health systems.</p><p>Health systems looking to add mHealth apps to their digital health portfolios must carefully select apps that align with their needs.</p>
