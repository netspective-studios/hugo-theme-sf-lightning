Chronic care management and remote patient monitoring take place outside the traditional healthcare setting and are effective in detecting negative health trends and preventing acuities in patients with various conditions.

**Improved Doctor-Patient Relationships:**

Explain to your patients how CCM and RPM allow for improved relationships between them and their caregivers. Mention how they help restore the doctor-patient relationship by empowering clinicians and taking advantage of the latest technologies to get the quality care they need.

**Reduced Hospitalization:**

Let your patients know that any negative trends will immediately be noticed through the CCM and RPM platforms, allowing for a quicker intervention and potentially keeping the patient out of the hospital.

**Improved Patient Awareness:**

The CCM and RPM platforms give patients the resources they need to understand their health problems better.
