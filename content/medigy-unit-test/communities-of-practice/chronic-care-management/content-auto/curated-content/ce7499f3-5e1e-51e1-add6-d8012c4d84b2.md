<p>COVID-19 seems like the final nail in the coffin for independent practices. Devastating financial losses from the start of the pandemic, stagnating patient volumes, and a new appetite for virtual care is making it more difficult for independent practices, to put it frankly, remain independent. “The jury is out, but COVID is probably going to exacerbate larger systems buying up independent practices because a lot of folks just aren’t going to be able to weather the storm long enough,” says Ryan Schmid, MBA, president and CEO of Vera Whole Health.</p><p>Schmid shares why the organization avoided financial losses during the pandemic and how value-based contracts and direct primary care can help independent practices survive.</p>
