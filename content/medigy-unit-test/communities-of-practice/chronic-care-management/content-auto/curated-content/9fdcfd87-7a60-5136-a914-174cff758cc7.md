<p>With the promise of new vaccines, there has been great speculation around how to distribute the vaccine in historically marginalized communities, including racial and individuals living in poverty, who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. With the advent of multiple vaccine options with early evidence of high efficacy, a pressing question for policymakers is the role of digital health in delivering vaccines equitably.</p><p>Digital health can help spread accurate and personalized health information about the vaccine to the community. One model to consider is the public-private partnership Text4Baby, which provides expectant mothers with reminders, health information, and information about community resources through text messages and a mobile app-based system.</p><p>Mobile apps powered by real-time tracking data on vaccinations can enable community health workers to go door to door providing tailored health information to households that have not been vaccinated and encouraging them to get vaccinated at local delivery sites.</p>
