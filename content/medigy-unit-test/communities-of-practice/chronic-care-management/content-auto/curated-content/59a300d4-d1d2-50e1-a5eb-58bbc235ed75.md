<p>It is a grim irony that the greatest health crisis of our generation separated most Americans from their healthcare providers. During the early months of the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic, most medical practices that responsibly followed social-distancing guidelines drastically limited in-person visits or were shuttered entirely. But as doctors start to open their doors to patients again, one thing should be clear: We cannot go back to the way things used to be.&nbsp;</p><p>For even though pre-COVID surveys showed that patients love their doctors, they also showed that they don’t love their interactions with their practices. Now, medical practices have a chance to re-imagine their businesses in a way that will strengthen their relationship with their patients and leave both better off.&nbsp;</p>
