<p>The way we give and receive health care looks starkly different today than it did a few months or even years ago. Providers’ care processes and communication methods that have long followed an “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” ideology have grown obsolete and in need of a new strategy. Like most things, the changing environment can’t help but impact patient engagement today and how patients should be engaged moving forward.</p><p>Patient engagement has become increasingly important as the on-demand care market continues to boom, giving the “patient-consumer” more options than ever. Now, with fear and confusion causing many patients to avoid seeking the care they need, we must ask ourselves how should we be engaging these patients?</p>
