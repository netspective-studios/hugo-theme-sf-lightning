<p>To succeed with big data initiatives, healthcare organizations must manage the enormous – and exponentially growing – amount of data flowing through their enterprise. In order to use data effectively, healthcare organizations must adopt the technology and tools needed to securely store data while also making it accessible to provide better patient care to improve outcomes.</p><p>Further, this approach provides the right foundation for leveraging AI, ML and NLP technologies. Ultimately, realizing the promise of big data, organizations will be able to deliver more actionable data at the point of patient interaction, offer more preventive health intervention, and provider more evidence to improve care – resulting in better care outcomes across communities.&nbsp;</p>
