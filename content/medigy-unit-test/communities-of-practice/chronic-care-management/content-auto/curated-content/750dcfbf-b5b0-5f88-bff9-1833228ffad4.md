<p>The&nbsp;adoption of telemedicine&nbsp;is&nbsp;shifting&nbsp;into hyper-drive,&nbsp;with virtual healthcare interactions on pace to&nbsp;top 1 billion&nbsp;by year’s end. When we&nbsp;surveyed&nbsp;hundreds of healthcare marketers about&nbsp;which&nbsp;projects&nbsp;they&nbsp;are planning post-COVID-19, telemedicine&nbsp;was&nbsp;the top response, with 50% saying&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a major upcoming initiative.
