<p>Managing patients with multiple chronic conditions-who, according to the RAND Corp., account for about <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/tools/TL200/TL221/RAND_TL221.pdf">a quarter of the U.S. population but more than two-thirds of healthcare costs</a>-is critical to success in value-based models.</p><p>The only problem? The health system was purpose-built for episodic care rather than the ongoing, community-based care this population typically needs.</p><p>To learn more about the challenges of managing chronic care, Sage Growth Partners conducted <a href="http://www.signallamphealth.com/relationships-the-key-to-better-chronic-care/">a survey of over 100 healthcare leaders in early 2019</a>. Respondents were roughly equally divided between health system executives and leaders of physician practices.</p><p>What we found is a large gap between need and ability. While virtually all (98%) respondents believe chronic care management is very important, only about half (53%) say they’re doing it very well.</p>
