<p>In the early weeks of the pandemic, Merahn worked with a practice in the Bronx with 29 clinics serving a high proportion of low-income, high-risk patients that saw significant increases in cancellations because of safety concerns.</p><p>While visit and procedure volumes rebounded for many practices, it was the rapid expansion of telehealth that enabled the restoration of those care connections between physicians and patients. “I think we probably did about 600 [telehealth] visits in the first week of the pandemic in New York City,” Merahn says. “Four weeks later, no exaggeration, we did 9,000 telehealth visits a week” among the 300 providers in the group.</p>
