The push to expand telehealth services in medical practices nationwide, following new flexibilities provided by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) in March, was nothing short of a digital gold rush. A majority (97%) of practice leaders reported expanding telehealth access amid the COVID-19 pandemic, per a March 31 MGMA Stat poll, and that rapid expansion has been a boon for telehealth startups: Digital health companies reported closing significant rounds of funding in recent weeks, per _Inc._ magazine.  
For medical practice leaders that now have a few weeks or months or telehealth services under their belts, it’s important to understand how to get the most out of this new model of care in terms of scheduling, quality of care and reimbursement.
