<p>Covid-19 has magnified systemic health inequities that have long been perpetuated by barriers in access to care, physician bias, and financial disincentives. Many minority communities are experiencing difficulties accessing Covid-19 testing due to unequal site distribution, lack of transportation, and limited hours of operation. Compounding matters further, minorities are more likely to work in frontline jobs considered “essential” and live in densely populated neighborhoods and residences, both of which dramatically increase the risk of infection.</p><p>History has shown that one of the largest challenges in vaccine distribution is convincing the public of a vaccine’s safety and efficacy. This is especially concerning as public distrust of a vaccine is higher than ever due to healthcare politicization and is especially high among Black Americans.</p>
