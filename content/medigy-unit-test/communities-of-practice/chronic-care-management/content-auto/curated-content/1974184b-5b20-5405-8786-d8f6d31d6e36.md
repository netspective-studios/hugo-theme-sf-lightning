<p>While some physicians are beginning to see patient visits return to pre-COVID-19 volume, many independent practices are still struggling. In fact, nearly nine in 10 practice owners or partners that responded to&nbsp;a recent survey&nbsp;indicated they were concerned about the future of their practices, and more than half of all respondents (54%) were “very concerned.”</p><p>Months of reduced activity, particularly at practices that suspended elective procedures in the spring, have taken a heavy toll on revenue. To ensure patients can get access to the care they need, as well as their organization’s financial longevity, each health care provider needs to reassess their business strategy with an eye towards improvement in operations.</p>
