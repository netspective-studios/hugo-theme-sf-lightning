<p>In an industry as high-stakes and uncertain as healthcare, predictive analytics tools and patient identifiers have emerged as viable solutions for seamless, comprehensive care delivery.</p><p>These tactics can help organizations better understand and anticipate patients’ needs, enabling them to deliver necessary services and improve patient outcomes.</p><p>The health system can also forecast patients’ needs based on the care experiences of similar patients, Parris noted.</p><p>Using predictive analytics tools, providers were able to see days ahead of time which facility had a high chance of experiencing patient surges. The organization could direct resources to the places that needed them, avoiding any potential staffing or equipment shortages.</p><p>Going forward, the health system expects to continue refining predictive tools and patient matching to be able to improve the care experience.</p>
