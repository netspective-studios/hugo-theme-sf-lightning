<p>These disruptive innovations have greatly expanded access to healthcare services and, in many cases, significantly lowered the comparative cost of care on a per procedure or per visit basis when measured against the same procedure or visit at a general hospital or a medical clinic. The rate of disruption and decentralization in healthcare delivery is accelerating as consumers, employers, health plans, and governments continue to demand greater affordability and personalization in healthcare.</p><p>Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed the way healthcare services are being delivered and consumed. As patients adhere to stay-at-home and social distancing policies, facility-based visit volume has dropped precipitously. TransUnion Healthcare's analysis of 500+ hospitals across the United States indicates a decline of 32%-60% in visit volumes between the weeks of March 1 and March 29, when compared against pre-COVID-19 volumes.</p>
