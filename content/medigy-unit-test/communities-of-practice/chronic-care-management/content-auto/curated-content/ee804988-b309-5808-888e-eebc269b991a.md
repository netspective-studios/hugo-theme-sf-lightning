The way we manage chronic disease in the United States is fundamentally flawed and even counterintuitive.

The only way to adequately manage the chronic disease is by fundamentally shifting everything we believe to be true about disease management, by moving from our current retrospective, reactionary model of care. Virtual continuous care with remote monitoring and ongoing human accountability drives better outcomes, eliminates unnecessary healthcare spend, and empowers whole health to the populations who need our help.

Now is our moment to change, and I call on my fellow founders and executives — in _and_ out of healthcare — to do the hard things and make the tough choices that will change the way we manage and care for most of our population.
