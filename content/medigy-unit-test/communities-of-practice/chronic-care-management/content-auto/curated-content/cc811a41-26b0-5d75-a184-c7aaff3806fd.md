<p>In the past, virtual consultations delivered through video conferencing have often been used for patients who live in rural and remote areas so that they can receive care without travelling (RACGP 2019). However, with the recent changes implemented by the federal government in order to avoid unnecessary exposure of patients and healthcare professionals to COVID-19, video conferencing is likely to become the primary means of delivering care for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Therefore, it is of utmost importance that healthcare professionals and staff are familiar with the technology and equipment required, and have the knowledge and skills necessary to utilise it effectively for the delivery of high-quality remote care.</p>
