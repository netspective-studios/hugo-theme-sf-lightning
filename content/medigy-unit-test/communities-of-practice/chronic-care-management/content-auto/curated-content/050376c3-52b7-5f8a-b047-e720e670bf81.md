<p>Even before COVID-19, telemedicine's patient adoption was up 33% over last year at the beginning of 2020. With the resurgence of regional spikes in COVID-19 cases over the last month, telemedicine is increasing in utilization. The debate around telemedicine being a permanent part of our care delivery system in this country has ended.</p><p>As we consider telemedicine's role in the future of healthcare delivery, three core drivers will emerge that differentiate how successful practices function in a new hybrid ecosystem. Like in any ecosystem, the interplay between these functions is paramount to success.</p><p>In direct response to consumer demand, progressive practices are launching a phased approach to the new hybrid care delivery model. Longitudinal and preventive medicine is now being practiced. Emerging technologies allow a contactless patient experience to mitigate concerns of being in waiting rooms for those patients that truly need to be examined in-person.</p>
