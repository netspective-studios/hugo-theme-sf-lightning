<p>The huge impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global healthcare systems has prompted the search for novel tools to stem the tide. Attention has turned to the digital health community to provide possible health solutions in this time of unprecedented medical crisis to mitigate this pandemic's impact. The paper shall focus on how digital solutions can impact healthcare during this pandemic.</p><p><strong>Surveillance Systems for Suspected Patient Tracking:</strong></p><p>Digital DHIS2 based solutions can help capture information on high-risk passengers entering the country from at-risk countries to facilitate active COVID-19 surveillance. Various Governments worldwide are now engaging with agencies to develop such systems to record demographics, symptoms of COVID-19 disease, data of contacts at all ports of entry to later link confirmed cases with contacts, and even create lab requests and monitors patient outcomes.</p>
