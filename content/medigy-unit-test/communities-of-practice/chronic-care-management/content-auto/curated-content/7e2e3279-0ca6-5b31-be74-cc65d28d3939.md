Physicians in small private practices around the country have reported steep declines in revenues, drops so significant that some of them and their supporters have turned to GoFundMe—the platform best-known for helping patients pay their medical bills—to raise funds to help pay their overhead. Telemedicine has helped pick up only a small portion of the slack.

And in an online survey conducted in early May, the Texas Medical Association found that 68% of practicing physicians in that state had cut their work hours because of COVID-19, while 62% had their salaries reduced. A concerned, long-time patient—with her physician’s blessing—set up a GoFundMe page on April 20 for a Dallas family medicine practice. In a month, it raised $96 766.
