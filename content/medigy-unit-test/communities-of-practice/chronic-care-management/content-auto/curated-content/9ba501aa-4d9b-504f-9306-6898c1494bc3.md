<p>While the primary focus remains on keeping patients healthy and safe, today’s providers are continually challenged with attending to the business side of their practice, too.</p><p>For many practices, improving their billing and collections procedures, and ensuring they get paid properly for their services, has remained top of mind this year, particularly as the industry evolves to value-based care. But credentialing–one of the fundamental aspects of revenue cycle management (RCM)–is often overlooked. If practices and providers are not credentialed by government and private payers or neglect to renew their credentials, RCM is stopped. Without credentials, they cannot legally bill patients for services or collect revenue. It can take months to recover that revenue stream, with a very real risk of losing substantial income in the process.</p>
