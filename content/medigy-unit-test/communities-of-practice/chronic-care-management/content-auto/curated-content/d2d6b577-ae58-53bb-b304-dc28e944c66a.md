<p>Although it has struggled to keep pace with other industries in digital adoption, the healthcare industry can move fast when it must. The industry’s response to COVID-19 makes that clear. Almost overnight, the healthcare ecosystem took action to provide care for those in need and expanded access through telehealth at a scale never seen before. Looking ahead, there is an opportunity to use this tragedy as a spark for positive change to sustain and accelerate the digital advances made to engage patients more effectively and reshape healthcare.</p><p>Some healthcare providers may revert to business as usual post-pandemic. However, those with greater vision will use this time to accelerate innovation and make substantive changes to improve the healthcare experience and drive better more affordable care.</p>
