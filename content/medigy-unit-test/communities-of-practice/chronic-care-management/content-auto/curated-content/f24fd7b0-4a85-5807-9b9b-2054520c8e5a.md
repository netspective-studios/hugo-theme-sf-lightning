Advances in healthcare technology, particularly in remote patient monitoring (RPM), create a new generation of population health solutions that can aid chronic disease prevention and management. A recent report from Spyglass Consulting Group found that the increased emphasis on population health management has incentivized healthcare providers to adopt RPM solutions, and as many as 66% of hospitals and health systems have done so.

Today, healthcare providers treating patients with chronic diseases face multiple barriers when implementing treatment plans. The two most common challenges are infrequent follow-up with patients and limited access to clinical data that offers a precise, relevant, real-time, and integrated overview of a patientâ€™s daily life. RPM helps healthcare providers overcome these issues by combining analytics with real-time data collected through continuous remote monitoring.
