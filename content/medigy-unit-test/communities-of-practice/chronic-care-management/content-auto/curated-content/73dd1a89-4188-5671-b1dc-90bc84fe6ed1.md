<p>CMS laid out some examples of how an MCO could use the voluntary direct contracting model, including:</p><ul><li>Entering into value-based purchasing agreements with nursing facilities that factor in facility hospitalization rates</li><li>Establishing processes to connect beneficiaries with a primary care provider</li><li>Targeting care coordination resources toward beneficiaries that have a high risk of Medicare spending</li><li>Having care coordinators and in-home aides that provide Medicaid long-term services to help enrollees with managing medical appointments.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Any MCO that participates in direct contracting needs to get a letter of support from their state Medicaid agency to ensure participation aligns with any state-managed plans.</p>
