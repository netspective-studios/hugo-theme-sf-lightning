<p>For many, telehealth’s growth has been an eye-opener. One study found that only 25% of people had used telehealth services before the pandemic. Now, the majority say they’re likely to continue using it even once the pandemic has passed.

They also had to start planning for a post-pandemic future that will likely see patients rely on electronic health solutions far more than before COVID-19.</p><p>Implemented effectively, a digital-first approach reduces risks for patients and staff while streamlining the entire healthcare process.
