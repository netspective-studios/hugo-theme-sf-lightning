<p>Change has been a constant for the healthcare sector the majority of this year. The industry at large has been navigating the uncharted waters of the coronavirus pandemic, practices have quickly pivoted to telehealth and remote patient monitoring (RPM) to care for patients and minimize the spread of the disease, and providers have had to keep up with evolving treatment protocols, while researchers race to develop a new vaccine.</p><p>The need for interoperable technology is crucial, yet it has not been broadly available for so long. In their daily lives, individuals are accustomed to using computers and smartphones for everything from booking a vacation rental to banking online, with data shared through application programming interfaces (APIs) using privacy and security protocols.</p>
