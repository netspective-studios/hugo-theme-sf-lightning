<p>In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. healthcare providers saw a dramatic&nbsp;spike in telemedicine visits. Telemedicine technology emerged as a valuable service offering access to care during a time when many people, especially those in COVID high-risk groups, were wary of going to the clinic or the urgent care center.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past few months we’ve seen the loosening of restrictions and insurance purse strings, which have allowed telemedicine offerings to expand significantly. While some patients have moved back to in-person visits for ambulatory care services, there is a concern that some are deferring or delaying care. If this is the case, we could see a worsening of disease and potentially avoidable events.&nbsp;</p>
