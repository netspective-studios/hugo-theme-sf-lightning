<p>Healthcare organizations around the country are struggling financially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the&nbsp;American Hospital Association&nbsp;(AHA), projected total losses for the nation’s hospitals and health systems are estimated to be at least $323.1 billion in 2020. While it may be difficult to focus on finances during this unprecedented health crisis, it is imperative to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Merging clinical and financial perspectives creates synergies in patient care, data management, and operational decision making that lead to health-fostering impacts for patients, physicians, and the health system alike. Equally important is leveraging the insight gained from data to implement and manage necessary changes to improve a healthcare organization’s processes, systems, and bottom line.&nbsp;</p>
