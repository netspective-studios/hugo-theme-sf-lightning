<p>Zip code, not just genetic code, is a signiﬁcant driver of health outcomes. Indeed, the environmental, social, cultural, community, economic, and educational inﬂuences on people’s health over time—collectively known as the social determinants of health (SDOH)—variably impact people's ability to lead healthy lives over time.</p><p>Signiﬁcant hurdles organizations continue to face include identifying barriers to care as they arise, creating workﬂows for resolving these barriers, and establishing a mechanism for ongoing monitoring to ensure interventions to address these barriers take place. We recommend your organization follow these three steps to optimize your digital health management strategy to better identify and address the SDOH among your patient population.</p>
