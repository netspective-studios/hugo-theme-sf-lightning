<p>Prior authorization is a process in which providers have to go through on behalf of their patients to get approval from the health plan to provide a service and get paid for it. This process is often reserved for procedures and diagnostics. It's probably the biggest burden in the diagnostic process, just because you're anxious to get to a diagnosis. You'll also hear it referred to as pre-certification.</p><p>Proper documentation and understanding of what is needed to attain the authorization are very, very important. It's important from a training perspective. And it's important that this team working on the authorization process is giving that feedback to the physicians, the physician extenders, so the medical assistants, the nurses, and the physician assistants, if you will.</p>
