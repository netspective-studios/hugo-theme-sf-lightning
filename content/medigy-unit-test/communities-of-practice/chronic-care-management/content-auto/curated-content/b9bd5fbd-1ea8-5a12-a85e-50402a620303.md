<p>As healthcare organizations work to cut costs and deliver services amid shrinking revenues and high patient traffic during COVID-19, leaders might identify where scalable, pay-as-you-go IT infrastructure could help.&nbsp;U.S. non-federal hospitals lost approximately $161.4 billion in revenue during the four months after the pandemic was declared,&nbsp;the American Hospital Association notes. And nearly one-third of healthcare executives plan to cut IT spending in the next 12 months,&nbsp;according to an October report&nbsp;by the Healthcare Financial Management Association.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond maintaining continuity during a health crisis, another challenge persists. Teams must&nbsp;explore and deploy innovations such as expanded virtual desktop infrastructure for remote staff and&nbsp;scaling up telehealth&nbsp;â€” efforts that demand increasingly more resources.</p>
