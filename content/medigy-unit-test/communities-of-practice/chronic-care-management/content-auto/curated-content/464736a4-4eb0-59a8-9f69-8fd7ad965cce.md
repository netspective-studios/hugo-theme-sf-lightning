<p>In care delivery today, it’s well understood that a patient’s social determinants of health have a profound impact on physical well-being and healthcare spending – sometimes even more so than clinical factors.</p><p>Although the importance of addressing individuals’ social needs is widely known, many providers still struggle to identify and document the non-medical factors affecting patients’ health. And even if they can, clinicians then have to clear the next difficult hurdle: referring patients to the right services that will meet their needs.</p><p>To help clinicians communicate more easily with social service entities, Reider and his team partnered with digital referral platform Unite Us, implementing their platform to develop Healthy Together, a closed-loop network that connects physicians, organizations, and community members in one platform. The tool allows Alliance to quickly identify and address social determinants of health, eliminating silos between each party.</p>
