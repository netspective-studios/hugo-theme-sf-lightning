This guidance is based on the Medicare program’s coding and coverage policies, since it is the largest payer of health care services and its
policies are often used by private payers. Although this guidance is an informed opinion of respiratory therapists and advisers who
have experience and knowledge of codes and coverage policies, we suggest you verify the patient’s eligibility and payer coding
requirements before providing a service as benefits are subject to specific plan policies which can vary among both public and
private payers.
