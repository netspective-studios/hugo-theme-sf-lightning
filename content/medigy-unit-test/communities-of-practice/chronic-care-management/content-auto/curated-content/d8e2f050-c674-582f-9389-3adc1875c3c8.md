<p>Customer experience is everything, especially for healthcare businesses.</p><p>However, there seems to be a gap between healthcare providers and their consumers.&nbsp;Studies&nbsp;show that 81% of patients are unsatisfied with their healthcare experience. While consumers believe their experience with a specialist should be as important as its products and services, they also think healthcare providers are&nbsp;more focused on industry needs&nbsp;than their patients’ needs. To address this&nbsp;gap, healthcare providers have started automating their customer experience (CX). Adopting and getting used to these digital innovations in healthcare can be crucial, but they will bring us to a future with limitless possibilities.</p>
