<p>Unfortunately, the problem of uncompensated care will only get worse as the pandemic progresses and its economic toll worsens. In the first half of 2020, 43% of Americans were uninsured, had gaps in their insurance, or were unable to afford their out-of-pocket costs and deductibles. By the end of the year, 10 million Americans could lose their health insurance due to pandemic-related job losses, adding to hospitals’ uncompensated care woes.</p><p>To prevent uncompensated care, providers need to proactively find patients who may need care they can’t afford and help them find a way to pay for their care before they need it.</p><p>Prescriptive clinical AI is a powerful tool that can help providers prevent uncompensated care by identifying patients likely to need significant care, seek that care from their specific facility, and lack the means to cover the costs.&nbsp;</p>
