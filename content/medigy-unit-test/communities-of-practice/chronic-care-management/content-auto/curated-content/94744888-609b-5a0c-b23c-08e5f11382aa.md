<p>Even with all the data gathered during this pandemic, there is still so much that we don’t know about the virus and won’t know for years to come. In response, the health care industry needs to gather as much data about patients and vaccine recipients as possible to guide treatment decisions, identify risks, and inform standards of care.</p><p>In the near term, this data will help us to better understand the acute impact of the disease and the effectiveness of new vaccines. In the long term, real-world data from COVID-19 patients will show us how the virus impairs the body, what new health risks it creates, and what long-term complications will emerge.</p>
