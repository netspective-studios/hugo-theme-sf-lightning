<p>Value-based care is designed to improve quality outcomes, reduce costs, and provide a holistic view of patient needs. To achieve these outcomes, healthcare organizations must focus on patient engagement, as well as better communication and collaboration among providers and staff throughout the continuum of care.</p><p>As healthcare providers transition to value-based care, they are realizing that better coordination within their organizations, as well as with other parts of the healthcare ecosystem, is the key to success. This includes communication and coordination with patients and their families. Clinical communications platforms play a central role in keeping all the stakeholders connected.</p>
