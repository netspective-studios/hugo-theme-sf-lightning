<p>Cloud has become a reality. In this Dell Technologies Healthcare Multi-Cloud interview with David Sarson, Global Alliance Manger, Healthcare Multi-Cloud and Clark LeFavour, Senior Director, Systems Engineering, we learn how healthcare organizations can more effectively leverage cloud technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>We look at the impact of COVID-19 on cloud adoption and discuss important topics like ensuring that your cloud infrastructure is secure. Plus, we discuss the issue of latency and why it's important in healthcare to have a multi-cloud approach that ensures your infrastructure can support the response times needed to provide timely information at the point of care with no delay. We also discuss how to create an effective cloud strategy to prepare you for future challenges that come to healthcare.</p>
