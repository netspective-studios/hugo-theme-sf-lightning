<p>To participate, you must have a certified electronic medical record with the ability for patients to use it for communication with the office. Patient consent must be documented, although this does not have to be done in-person for patients who have been seen within one year. The monthly $43 Medicare payment is subject to copayment and deductibles. Thankfully many patients have secondary insurance policies to supplement their Medicare and cover these costs. &nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOOxvfImcHs">Read on youtube.com</a></p>
