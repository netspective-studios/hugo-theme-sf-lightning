While technology certainly hasn’t solved all our problems, one thing technology has provided healthcare is the opportunity to really personalize patient engagement at scale. The stark reality is that healthcare organizations are being required to do more with less and this has been exacerbated by COVID-19. At least part of the solution to this challenge is to leverage technology to personalize engagement with patients in order to drive optimal population health outcomes.

Here&#39;s a look at some of the questions we discussed:

\-Is broad-based patient engagement dead in healthcare?

\-How has technology allowed us to personalize engagement with patients today? What does it take to really make this effective?

\-How do you measure the effectiveness of messaging? How do you use those measures to improve future response?
