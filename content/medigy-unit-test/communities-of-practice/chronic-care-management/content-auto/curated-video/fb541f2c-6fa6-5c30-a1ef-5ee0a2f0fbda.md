<p>Everyone in healthcare likes to talk about interoperability...or the lack thereof. Although, there's a lot of different types of healthcare interoperability. While most of the interoperability discussion is around clinical interoperability, we wanted to take a minute and talk about other areas of interoperability that we don't talk about nearly as much. In this episode, we talk about the health pricing transparency rule and how that information is being shared, along with whether the rule will change patient behavior. Then, we also dive into operational data interoperability, including things like COVID data and SDoH data.</p>
