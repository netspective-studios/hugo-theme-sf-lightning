<p>The Learning and Diffusion Group at the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) is launching a three-part video series to educate clinicians on successfully participating in value-based healthcare. This series is a part of the global strategy for ensuring widespread adoption of alternative payment models. Each video uses a patient and clinician story to highlight key concepts in the video and showcases some of the more prominent payment models tested by CMMI.&nbsp;</p><p>The second video in the series introduces the concept of upside risk, showing providers where and how they can get started in value-based care redesign. In this video, CMMI Senior Advisor and Medical Officer Sanjay Doddamani, MD, interviews value-based care thought leader and Venrock partner Bob Kocher, MD.</p>
