With the increasing number of reimbursement codes and interest from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in paying for Chronic Care Management (CCM) services in Medicare, opportunities are available to CHCs to take advantage of utilizing remote patient technology (RPM) to address their communityâ€™s needs. By managing chronic conditions, more severe health episodes may be avoided leading to a potentially cost-saving and better quality of life for patients.
