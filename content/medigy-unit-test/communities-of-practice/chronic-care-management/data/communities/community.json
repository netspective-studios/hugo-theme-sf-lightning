            "topicDescription": "Although the knowledge on chronic diseases has significantly improved, the person-centred care that patients receive has still not kept pace. This perhaps is largely because most traditional chronic care models fail to adequately address the needs of patients. \nThis section aims to address such barriers to care in chronic diseases and eventually provide  actionable steps that a healthcare professional and associated allied healthcare staff can confidently follow to bridge the treatment gap and effectively improve interactions with the patients through adequate communication channels. The elaborated strategies discussed in the articles will provide a helpful starting point for care providers to recognise and consequently remove any such barriers that may exist.  The barriers and guidelines thus identified in this CoP can be used to build knowledge on how to adapt the strategies to various care settings.",
